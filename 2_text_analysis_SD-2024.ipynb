but as it will take me two or three more\\nyears to complete it, and as my health is far from strong, I have been\\nurged to publish this Abstract.', 'I have more especially been induced to\\ndo this, as Mr. Wallace, who is now studying the natural history of\\nthe Malay archipelago, has arrived at almost exactly the same general\\nconclusions that I have on the origin of species.', 'Last year he sent to\\nme a memoir on this subject, with a request that I would forward it\\nto Sir Charles Lyell, who sent it to the Linnean Society, and it is\\npublished in the third volume of the Journal of that Society.', \"Sir C.\\nLyell and Dr. Hooker, who both knew of my work--the latter having read\\nmy sketch of 1844--honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish, with\\nMr. Wallace's excellent memoir, some brief extracts from my manuscripts.\", 'This Abstract, which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect.', 'I\\ncannot here give references and authorities for my several statements;\\nand I must trust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy.', 'No doubt errors will have crept in, though I hope I have always been\\ncautious in trusting to good authorities alone.', 'I can here give only\\nthe general conclusions at which I have arrived, with a few facts in\\nillustration, but which, I hope, in most cases will suffice.', 'No one can\\nfeel more sensible than I do of the necessity of hereafter publishing in\\ndetail all the facts, with references, on which my conclusions have been\\ngrounded; and I hope in a future work to do this.', 'For I am well aware\\nthat scarcely a single point is discussed in this volume on which facts\\ncannot be adduced, often apparently leading to conclusions directly\\nopposite to those at which I have arrived.', 'A fair result can be obtained\\nonly by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on both\\nsides of each question; and this cannot possibly be here done.', 'I much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of\\nacknowledging the generous assistance which I have received from very\\nmany naturalists, some of them personally unknown to me.', 'I cannot,\\nhowever, let this opportunity pass without expressing my deep\\nobligations to Dr. Hooker, who for the last fifteen years has aided me\\nin every possible way by his large stores of knowledge and his excellent\\njudgment.', 'In considering the Origin of Species, it is quite conceivable that a\\nnaturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings,\\non their embryological relations, their geographical distribution,\\ngeological succession, and other such facts, might come to the\\nconclusion that each species had not been independently created, but\\nhad descended, like varieties, from other species.', 'Nevertheless, such\\na conclusion, even if well founded, would be unsatisfactory, until it\\ncould be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world\\nhave been modified, so as to acquire that perfection of structure and\\ncoadaptation which most justly excites our admiration.', 'Naturalists\\ncontinually refer to external conditions, such as climate, food, etc.,\\nas the only possible cause of variation.', 'In one very limited sense,\\nas we shall hereafter see, this may be true; but it is preposterous to\\nattribute to mere external conditions, the structure, for instance,\\nof the woodpecker, with its feet, tail, beak, and tongue, so admirably\\nadapted to catch insects under the bark of trees.', 'In the case of the\\nmisseltoe, which draws its nourishment from certain trees, which has\\nseeds that must be transported by certain birds, and which has flowers\\nwith separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain insects\\nto bring pollen from one flower to the other, it is equally preposterous\\nto account for the structure of this parasite, with its relations to\\nseveral distinct organic beings, by the effects of external conditions,\\nor of habit, or of the volition of the plant itself.', \"The author of the 'Vestiges of Creation' would, I presume, say that,\\nafter a certain unknown number of generations, some bird had given birth\\nto a woodpecker, and some plant to the misseltoe, and that these had\\nbeen produced perfect as we now see them; but this assumption seems to\\nme to be no explanation, for it leaves the case of the coadaptations of\\norganic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life,\\nuntouched and unexplained.\", 'It is, therefore, of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into\\nthe means of modification and coadaptation.', 'At the commencement of\\nmy observations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of\\ndomesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best\\nchance of making out this obscure problem.', 'Nor have I been disappointed;\\nin this and in all other perplexing cases I have invariably found that\\nour knowledge, imperfect though it be, of variation under domestication,\\nafforded the best and safest clue.', 'I may venture to express my\\nconviction of the high value of such studies, although they have been\\nvery commonly neglected by naturalists.', 'From these considerations, I shall devote the first chapter of this\\nAbstract to Variation under Domestication.', 'We shall thus see that a\\nlarge amount of hereditary modification is at least possible, and, what\\nis equally or more important, we shall see how great is the power of man\\nin accumulating by his Selection successive slight variations.', 'I will\\nthen pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature; but\\nI shall, unfortunately, be compelled to treat this subject far too\\nbriefly, as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of\\nfacts.', 'We shall, however, be enabled to discuss what circumstances\\nare most favourable to variation.', 'In the next chapter the Struggle\\nfor Existence amongst all organic beings throughout the world, which\\ninevitably follows from their high geometrical powers of increase, will\\nbe treated of.', 'This is the doctrine of Malthus, applied to the whole\\nanimal and vegetable kingdoms.', 'As many more individuals of each species\\nare born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a\\nfrequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being,\\nif it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under\\nthe complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better\\nchance of surviving, and thus be NATURALLY SELECTED.', 'From the strong\\nprinciple of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate\\nits new and modified form.', 'This fundamental subject of Natural Selection will be treated at\\nsome length in the fourth chapter; and we shall then see how Natural\\nSelection almost inevitably causes much Extinction of the less improved\\nforms of life and induces what I have called Divergence of Character.', 'In the next chapter I shall discuss the complex and little known laws of\\nvariation and of correlation of growth.', 'In the four succeeding chapters,\\nthe most apparent and gravest difficulties on the theory will be given:\\nnamely, first, the difficulties of transitions, or in understanding how\\na simple being or a simple organ can be changed and perfected into a\\nhighly developed being or elaborately constructed organ; secondly\\nthe subject of Instinct, or the mental powers of animals, thirdly,\\nHybridism, or the infertility of species and the fertility of varieties\\nwhen intercrossed; and fourthly, the imperfection of the Geological\\nRecord.', 'In the next chapter I shall consider the geological succession\\nof organic beings throughout time; in the eleventh and twelfth, their\\ngeographical distribution throughout space; in the thirteenth, their\\nclassification or mutual affinities, both when mature and in an\\nembryonic condition.', 'In the last chapter I shall give a brief\\nrecapitulation of the whole work, and a few concluding remarks.', 'No one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in\\nregard to the origin of species and varieties, if he makes due allowance\\nfor our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of all\\nthe beings which live around us.', 'Who can explain why one species ranges\\nwidely and is very numerous, and why another allied species has a narrow\\nrange and is rare?', 'Yet these relations are of the highest importance,\\nfor they determine the present welfare, and, as I believe, the future\\nsuccess and modification of every inhabitant of this world.', 'Still less\\ndo we know of the mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the\\nworld during the many past geological epochs in its history.', 'Although\\nmuch remains obscure, and will long remain obscure, I can entertain no\\ndoubt, after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of\\nwhich I am capable, that the view which most naturalists entertain,\\nand which I formerly entertained--namely, that each species has been\\nindependently created--is erroneous.', 'I am fully convinced that species\\nare not immutable; but that those belonging to what are called the\\nsame genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct\\nspecies, in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one\\nspecies are the descendants of that species.', 'Furthermore, I am convinced\\nthat Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of\\nmodification.', '1.', 'VARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION.', 'Causes of Variability.', 'Effects of Habit.', 'Correlation of Growth.', 'Inheritance.', 'Character of Domestic Varieties.', 'Difficulty of\\ndistinguishing between Varieties and Species.', 'Origin of Domestic\\nVarieties from one or more Species.', 'Domestic Pigeons, their Differences\\nand Origin.', 'Principle of Selection anciently followed, its Effects.', 'Methodical and Unconscious Selection.', 'Unknown Origin of our Domestic\\nProductions.', \"Circumstances favourable to Man's power of Selection.\", 'When we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of\\nour older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which\\nstrikes us, is, that they generally differ much more from each other,\\nthan do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of\\nnature.', 'When we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals\\nwhich have been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under\\nthe most different climates and treatment, I think we are driven to\\nconclude that this greater variability is simply due to our domestic\\nproductions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform\\nas, and somewhat different from, those to which the parent-species have\\nbeen exposed under nature.', 'There is, also, I think, some probability\\nin the view propounded by Andrew Knight, that this variability may be\\npartly connected with excess of food.', 'It seems pretty clear that organic\\nbeings must be exposed during several generations to the new conditions\\nof life to cause any appreciable amount of variation; and that when the\\norganisation has once begun to vary, it generally continues to vary for\\nmany generations.', 'No case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be\\nvariable under cultivation.', 'Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat,\\nstill often yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are\\nstill capable of rapid improvement or modification.', 'It has been disputed at what period of life the causes of variability,\\nwhatever they may be, generally act; whether during the early or late\\nperiod of development of the embryo, or at the instant of conception.', \"Geoffroy St. Hilaire's experiments show that unnatural treatment of the\\nembryo causes monstrosities; and monstrosities cannot be separated by\\nany clear line of distinction from mere variations.\", 'But I am strongly\\ninclined to suspect that the most frequent cause of variability may\\nbe attributed to the male and female reproductive elements having been\\naffected prior to the act of conception.', 'Several reasons make me believe\\nin this; but the chief one is the remarkable effect which confinement or\\ncultivation has on the functions of the reproductive system; this\\nsystem appearing to be far more susceptible than any other part of the\\norganisation, to the action of any change in the conditions of life.', 'Nothing is more easy than to tame an animal, and few things more\\ndifficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement, even in the\\nmany cases when the male and female unite.', 'How many animals there\\nare which will not breed, though living long under not very close\\nconfinement in their native country!', 'This is generally attributed to\\nvitiated instincts; but how many cultivated plants display the utmost\\nvigour, and yet rarely or never seed!', 'In some few such cases it has\\nbeen found out that very trifling changes, such as a little more or less\\nwater at some particular period of growth, will determine whether or not\\nthe plant sets a seed.', 'I cannot here enter on the copious details which\\nI have collected on this curious subject; but to show how singular the\\nlaws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement,\\nI may just mention that carnivorous animals, even from the tropics,\\nbreed in this country pretty freely under confinement, with the\\nexception of the plantigrades or bear family; whereas, carnivorous\\nbirds, with the rarest exceptions, hardly ever lay fertile eggs.', 'Many\\nexotic plants have pollen utterly worthless, in the same exact\\ncondition as in the most sterile hybrids.', 'When, on the one hand, we\\nsee domesticated animals and plants, though often weak and sickly, yet\\nbreeding quite freely under confinement; and when, on the other hand,\\nwe see individuals, though taken young from a state of nature,\\nperfectly tamed, long-lived, and healthy (of which I could give numerous\\ninstances), yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected\\nby unperceived causes as to fail in acting, we need not be surprised\\nat this system, when it does act under confinement, acting not quite\\nregularly, and producing offspring not perfectly like their parents or\\nvariable.', 'Sterility has been said to be the bane of horticulture; but on this\\nview we owe variability to the same cause which produces sterility; and\\nvariability is the source of all the choicest productions of the garden.', 'I may add, that as some organisms will breed most freely under the\\nmost unnatural conditions (for instance, the rabbit and ferret kept\\nin hutches), showing that their reproductive system has not been thus\\naffected; so will some animals and plants withstand domestication or\\ncultivation, and vary very slightly--perhaps hardly more than in a state\\nof nature.', 'A long list could easily be given of \"sporting plants;\" by this term\\ngardeners mean a single bud or offset, which suddenly assumes a new and\\nsometimes very different character from that of the rest of the plant.', 'Such buds can be propagated by grafting, etc., and sometimes by seed.', 'These \"sports\" are extremely rare under nature, but far from rare under\\ncultivation; and in this case we see that the treatment of the parent\\nhas affected a bud or offset, and not the ovules or pollen.', 'But it is\\nthe opinion of most physiologists that there is no essential difference\\nbetween a bud and an ovule in their earliest stages of formation; so\\nthat, in fact, \"sports\" support my view, that variability may be largely\\nattributed to the ovules or pollen, or to both, having been affected by\\nthe treatment of the parent prior to the act of conception.', 'These cases\\nanyhow show that variation is not necessarily connected, as some authors\\nhave supposed, with the act of generation.', 'Seedlings from the same fruit, and the young of the same litter,\\nsometimes differ considerably from each other, though both the young\\nand the parents, as Muller has remarked, have apparently been exposed to\\nexactly the same conditions of life; and this shows how unimportant the\\ndirect effects of the conditions of life are in comparison with the laws\\nof reproduction, and of growth, and of inheritance; for had the action\\nof the conditions been direct, if any of the young had varied, all would\\nprobably have varied in the same manner.', 'To judge how much, in the case\\nof any variation, we should attribute to the direct action of heat,\\nmoisture, light, food, etc., is most difficult: my impression is, that\\nwith animals such agencies have produced very little direct effect,\\nthough apparently more in the case of plants.', \"Under this point of view,\\nMr. Buckman's recent experiments on plants seem extremely valuable.\", 'When all or nearly all the individuals exposed to certain conditions are\\naffected in the same way, the change at first appears to be directly\\ndue to such conditions; but in some cases it can be shown that quite\\nopposite conditions produce similar changes of structure.', 'Nevertheless\\nsome slight amount of change may, I think, be attributed to the direct\\naction of the conditions of life--as, in some cases, increased size from\\namount of food, colour from particular kinds of food and from light, and\\nperhaps the thickness of fur from climate.', 'Habit also has a decided influence, as in the period of flowering with\\nplants when transported from one climate to another.', 'In animals it has\\na more marked effect; for instance, I find in the domestic duck that\\nthe bones of the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more,\\nin proportion to the whole skeleton, than do the same bones in the\\nwild-duck; and I presume that this change may be safely attributed to\\nthe domestic duck flying much less, and walking more, than its wild\\nparent.', 'The great and inherited development of the udders in cows and\\ngoats in countries where they are habitually milked, in comparison with\\nthe state of these organs in other countries, is another instance of the\\neffect of use.', 'Not a single domestic animal can be named which has not\\nin some country drooping ears; and the view suggested by some authors,\\nthat the drooping is due to the disuse of the muscles of the ear, from\\nthe animals not being much alarmed by danger, seems probable.', 'There are many laws regulating variation, some few of which can be dimly\\nseen, and will be hereafter briefly mentioned.', 'I will here only allude\\nto what may be called correlation of growth.', 'Any change in the embryo\\nor larva will almost certainly entail changes in the mature animal.', \"In\\nmonstrosities, the correlations between quite distinct parts are very\\ncurious; and many instances are given in Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire's\\ngreat work on this subject.\", 'Breeders believe that long limbs are almost\\nalways accompanied by an elongated head.', 'Some instances of correlation\\nare quite whimsical; thus cats with blue eyes are invariably deaf;\\ncolour and constitutional peculiarities go together, of which many\\nremarkable cases could be given amongst animals and plants.', 'From the\\nfacts collected by Heusinger, it appears that white sheep and pigs are\\ndifferently affected from coloured individuals by certain vegetable\\npoisons.', 'Hairless dogs have imperfect teeth; long-haired and\\ncoarse-haired animals are apt to have, as is asserted, long or many\\nhorns; pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes;\\npigeons with short beaks have small feet, and those with long beaks\\nlarge feet.', 'Hence, if man goes on selecting, and thus augmenting, any\\npeculiarity, he will almost certainly unconsciously modify other parts\\nof the structure, owing to the mysterious laws of the correlation of\\ngrowth.', 'The result of the various, quite unknown, or dimly seen laws of\\nvariation is infinitely complex and diversified.', 'It is well worth while\\ncarefully to study the several treatises published on some of our old\\ncultivated plants, as on the hyacinth, potato, even the dahlia, etc.', ';\\nand it is really surprising to note the endless points in structure and\\nconstitution in which the varieties and sub-varieties differ slightly\\nfrom each other.', 'The whole organisation seems to have become plastic,\\nand tends to depart in some small degree from that of the parental type.', 'Any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us.', 'But the\\nnumber and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both\\nthose of slight and those of considerable physiological importance,\\nis endless.', \"Dr. Prosper Lucas's treatise, in two large volumes, is the\\nfullest and the best on this subject.\", 'No breeder doubts how strong\\nis the tendency to inheritance: like produces like is his fundamental\\nbelief: doubts have been thrown on this principle by theoretical writers\\nalone.', 'When a deviation appears not unfrequently, and we see it in the\\nfather and child, we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the same\\noriginal cause acting on both; but when amongst individuals, apparently\\nexposed to the same conditions, any very rare deviation, due to some\\nextraordinary combination of circumstances, appears in the parent--say,\\nonce amongst several million individuals--and it reappears in the\\nchild, the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute\\nits reappearance to inheritance.', 'Every one must have heard of cases of\\nalbinism, prickly skin, hairy bodies, etc., appearing in several members\\nof the same family.', 'If strange and rare deviations of structure are\\ntruly inherited, less strange and commoner deviations may be freely\\nadmitted to be inheritable.', 'Perhaps the correct way of viewing the\\nwhole subject, would be, to look at the inheritance of every character\\nwhatever as the rule, and non-inheritance as the anomaly.', 'The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown; no one can say why the\\nsame peculiarity in different individuals of the same species, and in\\nindividuals of different species, is sometimes inherited and sometimes\\nnot so; why the child often reverts in certain characters to its\\ngrandfather or grandmother or other much more remote ancestor; why a\\npeculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to both sexes or to one\\nsex alone, more commonly but not exclusively to the like sex.', 'It is a\\nfact of some little importance to us, that peculiarities appearing\\nin the males of our domestic breeds are often transmitted either\\nexclusively, or in a much greater degree, to males alone.', 'A much more\\nimportant rule, which I think may be trusted, is that, at whatever\\nperiod of life a peculiarity first appears, it tends to appear in the\\noffspring at a corresponding age, though sometimes earlier.', 'In many\\ncases this could not be otherwise: thus the inherited peculiarities\\nin the horns of cattle could appear only in the offspring when nearly\\nmature; peculiarities in the silkworm are known to appear at the\\ncorresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage.', 'But hereditary diseases and\\nsome other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider extension,\\nand that when there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity should\\nappear at any particular age, yet that it does tend to appear in the\\noffspring at the same period at which it first appeared in the parent.', 'I\\nbelieve this rule to be of the highest importance in explaining the\\nlaws of embryology.', 'These remarks are of course confined to the first\\nAPPEARANCE of the peculiarity, and not to its primary cause, which may\\nhave acted on the ovules or male element; in nearly the same manner as\\nin the crossed offspring from a short-horned cow by a long-horned bull,\\nthe greater length of horn, though appearing late in life, is clearly\\ndue to the male element.', 'Having alluded to the subject of reversion, I may here refer to\\na statement often made by naturalists--namely, that our domestic\\nvarieties, when run wild, gradually but certainly revert in character to\\ntheir aboriginal stocks.', 'Hence it has been argued that no deductions can\\nbe drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature.', 'I have in\\nvain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement\\nhas so often and so boldly been made.', 'There would be great difficulty\\nin proving its truth: we may safely conclude that very many of the most\\nstrongly-marked domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wild\\nstate.', 'In many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was, and\\nso could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued.', 'It would be quite necessary, in order to prevent the effects of\\nintercrossing, that only a single variety should be turned loose in\\nits new home.', 'Nevertheless, as our varieties certainly do occasionally\\nrevert in some of their characters to ancestral forms, it seems to me\\nnot improbable, that if we could succeed in naturalising, or were to\\ncultivate, during many generations, the several races, for instance,\\nof the cabbage, in very poor soil (in which case, however, some effect\\nwould have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil),\\nthat they would to a large extent, or even wholly, revert to the wild\\naboriginal stock.', 'Whether or not the experiment would succeed, is not of\\ngreat importance for our line of argument; for by the experiment itself\\nthe conditions of life are changed.', 'If it could be shown that our\\ndomestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion,--that\\nis, to lose their acquired characters, whilst kept under unchanged\\nconditions, and whilst kept in a considerable body, so that free\\nintercrossing might check, by blending together, any slight deviations\\nof structure, in such case, I grant that we could deduce nothing from\\ndomestic varieties in regard to species.', 'But there is not a shadow of\\nevidence in favour of this view: to assert that we could not breed\\nour cart and race-horses, long and short-horned cattle, and poultry of\\nvarious breeds, and esculent vegetables, for an almost infinite number\\nof generations, would be opposed to all experience.', 'I may add, that when\\nunder nature the conditions of life do change, variations and reversions\\nof character probably do occur; but natural selection, as will hereafter\\nbe explained, will determine how far the new characters thus arising\\nshall be preserved.', 'When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic\\nanimals and plants, and compare them with species closely allied\\ntogether, we generally perceive in each domestic race, as already\\nremarked, less uniformity of character than in true species.', 'Domestic\\nraces of the same species, also, often have a somewhat monstrous\\ncharacter; by which I mean, that, although differing from each other,\\nand from the other species of the same genus, in several trifling\\nrespects, they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part, both\\nwhen compared one with another, and more especially when compared with\\nall the species in nature to which they are nearest allied.', 'With these\\nexceptions (and with that of the perfect fertility of varieties when\\ncrossed,--a subject hereafter to be discussed), domestic races of the\\nsame species differ from each other in the same manner as, only in most\\ncases in a lesser degree than, do closely-allied species of the same\\ngenus in a state of nature.', 'I think this must be admitted, when we find\\nthat there are hardly any domestic races, either amongst animals or\\nplants, which have not been ranked by some competent judges as\\nmere varieties, and by other competent judges as the descendants of\\naboriginally distinct species.', 'If any marked distinction existed\\nbetween domestic races and species, this source of doubt could not so\\nperpetually recur.', 'It has often been stated that domestic races do not\\ndiffer from each other in characters of generic value.', 'I think it could\\nbe shown that this statement is hardly correct; but naturalists differ\\nmost widely in determining what characters are of generic value; all\\nsuch valuations being at present empirical.', 'Moreover, on the view of\\nthe origin of genera which I shall presently give, we have no right\\nto expect often to meet with generic differences in our domesticated\\nproductions.', 'When we attempt to estimate the amount of structural difference between\\nthe domestic races of the same species, we are soon involved in doubt,\\nfrom not knowing whether they have descended from one or several\\nparent-species.', 'This point, if it could be cleared up, would be\\ninteresting; if, for instance, it could be shown that the greyhound,\\nbloodhound, terrier, spaniel, and bull-dog, which we all know propagate\\ntheir kind so truly, were the offspring of any single species, then such\\nfacts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutability\\nof the many very closely allied and natural species--for instance, of\\nthe many foxes--inhabiting different quarters of the world.', 'I do not\\nbelieve, as we shall presently see, that all our dogs have descended\\nfrom any one wild species; but, in the case of some other domestic\\nraces, there is presumptive, or even strong, evidence in favour of this\\nview.', 'It has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals\\nand plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary, and\\nlikewise to withstand diverse climates.', 'I do not dispute that these\\ncapacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated\\nproductions; but how could a savage possibly know, when he first tamed\\nan animal, whether it would vary in succeeding generations, and whether\\nit would endure other climates?', 'Has the little variability of the ass or\\nguinea-fowl, or the small power of endurance of warmth by the rein-deer,\\nor of cold by the common camel, prevented their domestication?', 'I\\ncannot doubt that if other animals and plants, equal in number to our\\ndomesticated productions, and belonging to equally diverse classes and\\ncountries, were taken from a state of nature, and could be made to breed\\nfor an equal number of generations under domestication, they would\\nvary on an average as largely as the parent species of our existing\\ndomesticated productions have varied.', 'In the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants, I\\ndo not think it is possible to come to any definite conclusion, whether\\nthey have descended from one or several species.', 'The argument mainly\\nrelied on by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic\\nanimals is, that we find in the most ancient records, more especially on\\nthe monuments of Egypt, much diversity in the breeds; and that some of\\nthe breeds closely resemble, perhaps are identical with, those still\\nexisting.', 'Even if this latter fact were found more strictly and\\ngenerally true than seems to me to be the case, what does it show, but\\nthat some of our breeds originated there, four or five thousand years\\nago?', \"But Mr. Horner's researches have rendered it in some degree\\nprobable that man sufficiently civilized to have manufactured pottery\\nexisted in the valley of the Nile thirteen or fourteen thousand years\\nago; and who will pretend to say how long before these ancient periods,\\nsavages, like those of Tierra del Fuego or Australia, who possess a\\nsemi-domestic dog, may not have existed in Egypt?\", 'The whole subject must, I think, remain vague; nevertheless, I may,\\nwithout here entering on any details, state that, from geographical and\\nother considerations, I think it highly probable that our domestic dogs\\nhave descended from several wild species.', 'In regard to sheep and goats\\nI can form no opinion.', 'I should think, from facts communicated to me by\\nMr. Blyth, on the habits, voice, and constitution, etc., of the humped\\nIndian cattle, that these had descended from a different aboriginal\\nstock from our European cattle; and several competent judges believe\\nthat these latter have had more than one wild parent.', 'With respect to\\nhorses, from reasons which I cannot give here, I am doubtfully inclined\\nto believe, in opposition to several authors, that all the races have\\ndescended from one wild stock.', 'Mr. Blyth, whose opinion, from his large\\nand varied stores of knowledge, I should value more than that of almost\\nany one, thinks that all the breeds of poultry have proceeded from\\nthe common wild Indian fowl (Gallus bankiva).', 'In regard to ducks and\\nrabbits, the breeds of which differ considerably from each other in\\nstructure, I do not doubt that they all have descended from the common\\nwild duck and rabbit.', 'The doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several\\naboriginal stocks, has been carried to an absurd extreme by some\\nauthors.', 'They believe that every race which breeds true, let the\\ndistinctive characters be ever so slight, has had its wild prototype.', 'At this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild\\ncattle, as many sheep, and several goats in Europe alone, and several\\neven within Great Britain.', 'One author believes that there formerly\\nexisted in Great Britain eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to it!', 'When we bear in mind that Britain has now hardly one peculiar mammal,\\nand France but few distinct from those of Germany and conversely, and\\nso with Hungary, Spain, etc., but that each of these kingdoms possesses\\nseveral peculiar breeds of cattle, sheep, etc., we must admit that many\\ndomestic breeds have originated in Europe; for whence could they have\\nbeen derived, as these several countries do not possess a number of\\npeculiar species as distinct parent-stocks?', 'So it is in India.', 'Even in\\nthe case of the domestic dogs of the whole world, which I fully admit\\nhave probably descended from several wild species, I cannot doubt that\\nthere has been an immense amount of inherited variation.', 'Who can believe\\nthat animals closely resembling the Italian greyhound, the bloodhound,\\nthe bull-dog, or Blenheim spaniel, etc.--so unlike all wild\\nCanidae--ever existed freely in a state of nature?', 'It has often been\\nloosely said that all our races of dogs have been produced by the\\ncrossing of a few aboriginal species; but by crossing we can get only\\nforms in some degree intermediate between their parents; and if we\\naccount for our several domestic races by this process, we must\\nadmit the former existence of the most extreme forms, as the Italian\\ngreyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog, etc., in the wild state.', 'Moreover,\\nthe possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatly\\nexaggerated.', 'There can be no doubt that a race may be modified\\nby occasional crosses, if aided by the careful selection of those\\nindividual mongrels, which present any desired character; but that\\na race could be obtained nearly intermediate between two extremely\\ndifferent races or species, I can hardly believe.', 'Sir J. Sebright\\nexpressly experimentised for this object, and failed.', 'The offspring from\\nthe first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes (as I\\nhave found with pigeons) extremely uniform, and everything seems simple\\nenough; but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several\\ngenerations, hardly two of them will be alike, and then the extreme\\ndifficulty, or rather utter hopelessness, of the task becomes apparent.', 'Certainly, a breed intermediate between TWO VERY DISTINCT breeds could\\nnot be got without extreme care and long-continued selection; nor can\\nI find a single case on record of a permanent race having been thus\\nformed.', 'ON THE BREEDS OF THE DOMESTIC PIGEON.', 'Believing that it is always best to study some special group, I have,\\nafter deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons.', 'I have kept every breed\\nwhich I could purchase or obtain, and have been most kindly favoured\\nwith skins from several quarters of the world, more especially by the\\nHonourable W. Elliot from India, and by the Honourable C. Murray from\\nPersia.', 'Many treatises in different languages have been published on\\npigeons, and some of them are very important, as being of considerable\\nantiquity.', 'I have associated with several eminent fanciers, and have\\nbeen permitted to join two of the London Pigeon Clubs.', 'The diversity of\\nthe breeds is something astonishing.', 'Compare the English carrier and the\\nshort-faced tumbler, and see the wonderful difference in their beaks,\\nentailing corresponding differences in their skulls.', 'The carrier,\\nmore especially the male bird, is also remarkable from the wonderful\\ndevelopment of the carunculated skin about the head, and this is\\naccompanied by greatly elongated eyelids, very large external orifices\\nto the nostrils, and a wide gape of mouth.', 'The short-faced tumbler has a\\nbeak in outline almost like that of a finch; and the common tumbler has\\nthe singular and strictly inherited habit of flying at a great height in\\na compact flock, and tumbling in the air head over heels.', 'The runt is a\\nbird of great size, with long, massive beak and large feet; some of the\\nsub-breeds of runts have very long necks, others very long wings and\\ntails, others singularly short tails.', 'The barb is allied to the carrier,\\nbut, instead of a very long beak, has a very short and very broad\\none.', 'The pouter has a much elongated body, wings, and legs; and its\\nenormously developed crop, which it glories in inflating, may well\\nexcite astonishment and even laughter.', 'The turbit has a very short and\\nconical beak, with a line of reversed feathers down the breast; and it\\nhas the habit of continually expanding slightly the upper part of the\\noesophagus.', 'The Jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the back\\nof the neck that they form a hood, and it has, proportionally to its\\nsize, much elongated wing and tail feathers.', 'The trumpeter and laugher,\\nas their names express, utter a very different coo from the other\\nbreeds.', 'The fantail has thirty or even forty tail-feathers, instead of\\ntwelve or fourteen, the normal number in all members of the great pigeon\\nfamily; and these feathers are kept expanded, and are carried so erect\\nthat in good birds the head and tail touch; the oil-gland is quite\\naborted.', 'Several other less distinct breeds might have been specified.', 'In the skeletons of the several breeds, the development of the bones\\nof the face in length and breadth and curvature differs enormously.', 'The\\nshape, as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower\\njaw, varies in a highly remarkable manner.', 'The number of the caudal and\\nsacral vertebrae vary; as does the number of the ribs, together with\\ntheir relative breadth and the presence of processes.', 'The size and shape\\nof the apertures in the sternum are highly variable; so is the degree\\nof divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula.', 'The\\nproportional width of the gape of mouth, the proportional length of the\\neyelids, of the orifice of the nostrils, of the tongue (not always in\\nstrict correlation with the length of beak), the size of the crop and\\nof the upper part of the oesophagus; the development and abortion of\\nthe oil-gland; the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers; the\\nrelative length of wing and tail to each other and to the body; the\\nrelative length of leg and of the feet; the number of scutellae on\\nthe toes, the development of skin between the toes, are all points of\\nstructure which are variable.', 'The period at which the perfect plumage is\\nacquired varies, as does the state of the down with which the nestling\\nbirds are clothed when hatched.', 'The shape and size of the eggs vary.', 'The\\nmanner of flight differs remarkably; as does in some breeds the voice\\nand disposition.', 'Lastly, in certain breeds, the males and females have\\ncome to differ to a slight degree from each other.', 'Altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which if shown\\nto an ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would\\ncertainly, I think, be ranked by him as well-defined species.', 'Moreover,\\nI do not believe that any ornithologist would place the English carrier,\\nthe short-faced tumbler, the runt, the barb, pouter, and fantail in\\nthe same genus; more especially as in each of these breeds several\\ntruly-inherited sub-breeds, or species as he might have called them,\\ncould be shown him.', 'Great as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons, I am fully\\nconvinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct, namely,\\nthat all have descended from the rock-pigeon (Columba livia), including\\nunder this term several geographical races or sub-species, which differ\\nfrom each other in the most trifling respects.', 'As several of the reasons\\nwhich have led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other\\ncases, I will here briefly give them.', 'If the several breeds are not\\nvarieties, and have not proceeded from the rock-pigeon, they must have\\ndescended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks; for it is\\nimpossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing of any\\nlesser number: how, for instance, could a pouter be produced by crossing\\ntwo breeds unless one of the parent-stocks possessed the characteristic\\nenormous crop?', 'The supposed aboriginal stocks must all have been\\nrock-pigeons, that is, not breeding or willingly perching on trees.', 'But\\nbesides C. livia, with its geographical sub-species, only two or three\\nother species of rock-pigeons are known; and these have not any of the\\ncharacters of the domestic breeds.', 'Hence the supposed aboriginal stocks\\nmust either still exist in the countries where they were originally\\ndomesticated, and yet be unknown to ornithologists; and this,\\nconsidering their size, habits, and remarkable characters, seems very\\nimprobable; or they must have become extinct in the wild state.', 'But\\nbirds breeding on precipices, and good fliers, are unlikely to be\\nexterminated; and the common rock-pigeon, which has the same habits with\\nthe domestic breeds, has not been exterminated even on several of the\\nsmaller British islets, or on the shores of the Mediterranean.', 'Hence the\\nsupposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the\\nrock-pigeon seems to me a very rash assumption.', 'Moreover, the several\\nabove-named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of\\nthe world, and, therefore, some of them must have been carried back\\nagain into their native country; but not one has ever become wild or\\nferal, though the dovecot-pigeon, which is the rock-pigeon in a very\\nslightly altered state, has become feral in several places.', 'Again, all\\nrecent experience shows that it is most difficult to get any wild\\nanimal to breed freely under domestication; yet on the hypothesis of the\\nmultiple origin of our pigeons, it must be assumed that at least seven\\nor eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by\\nhalf-civilized man, as to be quite prolific under confinement.', 'An argument, as it seems to me, of great weight, and applicable in\\nseveral other cases, is, that the above-specified breeds, though\\nagreeing generally in constitution, habits, voice, colouring, and\\nin most parts of their structure, with the wild rock-pigeon, yet are\\ncertainly highly abnormal in other parts of their structure: we may look\\nin vain throughout the whole great family of Columbidae for a beak like\\nthat of the English carrier, or that of the short-faced tumbler, or\\nbarb; for reversed feathers like those of the jacobin; for a crop like\\nthat of the pouter; for tail-feathers like those of the fantail.', 'Hence it must be assumed not only that half-civilized man succeeded in\\nthoroughly domesticating several species, but that he intentionally or\\nby chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species; and further, that\\nthese very species have since all become extinct or unknown.', 'So many\\nstrange contingencies seem to me improbable in the highest degree.', 'Some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve\\nconsideration.', 'The rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue, and has a white rump\\n(the Indian sub-species, C. intermedia of Strickland, having it bluish);\\nthe tail has a terminal dark bar, with the bases of the outer feathers\\nexternally edged with white; the wings have two black bars; some\\nsemi-domestic breeds and some apparently truly wild breeds have, besides\\nthe two black bars, the wings chequered with black.', 'These several marks\\ndo not occur together in any other species of the whole family.', 'Now, in\\nevery one of the domestic breeds, taking thoroughly well-bred birds, all\\nthe above marks, even to the white edging of the outer tail-feathers,\\nsometimes concur perfectly developed.', 'Moreover, when two birds belonging\\nto two distinct breeds are crossed, neither of which is blue or has\\nany of the above-specified marks, the mongrel offspring are very apt\\nsuddenly to acquire these characters; for instance, I crossed some\\nuniformly white fantails with some uniformly black barbs, and they\\nproduced mottled brown and black birds; these I again crossed together,\\nand one grandchild of the pure white fantail and pure black barb was of\\nas beautiful a blue colour, with the white rump, double black wing-bar,\\nand barred and white-edged tail-feathers, as any wild rock-pigeon!', 'We\\ncan understand these facts, on the well-known principle of reversion to\\nancestral characters, if all the domestic breeds have descended from the\\nrock-pigeon.', 'But if we deny this, we must make one of the two following\\nhighly improbable suppositions.', 'Either, firstly, that all the\\nseveral imagined aboriginal stocks were coloured and marked like the\\nrock-pigeon, although no other existing species is thus coloured and\\nmarked, so that in each separate breed there might be a tendency to\\nrevert to the very same colours and markings.', 'Or, secondly, that each\\nbreed, even the purest, has within a dozen or, at most, within a score\\nof generations, been crossed by the rock-pigeon: I say within a dozen or\\ntwenty generations, for we know of no fact countenancing the belief that\\nthe child ever reverts to some one ancestor, removed by a greater number\\nof generations.', 'In a breed which has been crossed only once with some\\ndistinct breed, the tendency to reversion to any character derived from\\nsuch cross will naturally become less and less, as in each succeeding\\ngeneration there will be less of the foreign blood; but when there has\\nbeen no cross with a distinct breed, and there is a tendency in both\\nparents to revert to a character, which has been lost during some former\\ngeneration, this tendency, for all that we can see to the contrary, may\\nbe transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations.', 'These two distinct cases are often confounded in treatises on\\ninheritance.', 'Lastly, the hybrids or mongrels from between all the domestic breeds\\nof pigeons are perfectly fertile.', 'I can state this from my own\\nobservations, purposely made on the most distinct breeds.', 'Now, it is\\ndifficult, perhaps impossible, to bring forward one case of the hybrid\\noffspring of two animals CLEARLY DISTINCT being themselves perfectly\\nfertile.', 'Some authors believe that long-continued domestication\\neliminates this strong tendency to sterility: from the history of the\\ndog I think there is some probability in this hypothesis, if applied to\\nspecies closely related together, though it is unsupported by a single\\nexperiment.', 'But to extend the hypothesis so far as to suppose that\\nspecies, aboriginally as distinct as carriers, tumblers, pouters, and\\nfantails now are, should yield offspring perfectly fertile, inter se,\\nseems to me rash in the extreme.', 'From these several reasons, namely, the improbability of man having\\nformerly got seven or eight supposed species of pigeons to breed freely\\nunder domestication; these supposed species being quite unknown in a\\nwild state, and their becoming nowhere feral; these species having very\\nabnormal characters in certain respects, as compared with all other\\nColumbidae, though so like in most other respects to the rock-pigeon;\\nthe blue colour and various marks occasionally appearing in all the\\nbreeds, both when kept pure and when crossed; the mongrel offspring\\nbeing perfectly fertile;--from these several reasons, taken together, I\\ncan feel no doubt that all our domestic breeds have descended from the\\nColumba livia with its geographical sub-species.', 'In favour of this view, I may add, firstly, that C. livia, or the\\nrock-pigeon, has been found capable of domestication in Europe and in\\nIndia; and that it agrees in habits and in a great number of points of\\nstructure with all the domestic breeds.', 'Secondly, although an English\\ncarrier or short-faced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters\\nfrom the rock-pigeon, yet by comparing the several sub-breeds of these\\nbreeds, more especially those brought from distant countries, we\\ncan make an almost perfect series between the extremes of structure.', 'Thirdly, those characters which are mainly distinctive of each breed,\\nfor instance the wattle and length of beak of the carrier, the shortness\\nof that of the tumbler, and the number of tail-feathers in the fantail,\\nare in each breed eminently variable; and the explanation of this fact\\nwill be obvious when we come to treat of selection.', 'Fourthly, pigeons\\nhave been watched, and tended with the utmost care, and loved by many\\npeople.', 'They have been domesticated for thousands of years in several\\nquarters of the world; the earliest known record of pigeons is in the\\nfifth Aegyptian dynasty, about 3000 B.C., as was pointed out to me by\\nProfessor Lepsius; but Mr. Birch informs me that pigeons are given in a\\nbill of fare in the previous dynasty.', 'In the time of the Romans, as we\\nhear from Pliny, immense prices were given for pigeons; \"nay, they are\\ncome to this pass, that they can reckon up their pedigree and race.\"', 'Pigeons were much valued by Akber Khan in India, about the year 1600;\\nnever less than 20,000 pigeons were taken with the court.', '\"The monarchs\\nof Iran and Turan sent him some very rare birds;\" and, continues the\\ncourtly historian, \"His Majesty by crossing the breeds, which method\\nwas never practised before, has improved them astonishingly.\"', 'About\\nthis same period the Dutch were as eager about pigeons as were the old\\nRomans.', 'The paramount importance of these considerations in explaining\\nthe immense amount of variation which pigeons have undergone, will be\\nobvious when we treat of Selection.', 'We shall then, also, see how it is\\nthat the breeds so often have a somewhat monstrous character.', 'It is also\\na most favourable circumstance for the production of distinct breeds,\\nthat male and female pigeons can be easily mated for life; and thus\\ndifferent breeds can be kept together in the same aviary.', 'I have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some,\\nyet quite insufficient, length; because when I first kept pigeons and\\nwatched the several kinds, knowing well how true they bred, I felt fully\\nas much difficulty in believing that they could ever have descended\\nfrom a common parent, as any naturalist could in coming to a similar\\nconclusion in regard to the many species of finches, or other large\\ngroups of birds, in nature.', 'One circumstance has struck me much;\\nnamely, that all the breeders of the various domestic animals and\\nthe cultivators of plants, with whom I have ever conversed, or whose\\ntreatises I have read, are firmly convinced that the several breeds\\nto which each has attended, are descended from so many aboriginally\\ndistinct species.', 'Ask, as I have asked, a celebrated raiser of Hereford\\ncattle, whether his cattle might not have descended from long horns, and\\nhe will laugh you to scorn.', 'I have never met a pigeon, or poultry, or\\nduck, or rabbit fancier, who was not fully convinced that each main\\nbreed was descended from a distinct species.', 'Van Mons, in his treatise\\non pears and apples, shows how utterly he disbelieves that the several\\nsorts, for instance a Ribston-pippin or Codlin-apple, could ever have\\nproceeded from the seeds of the same tree.', 'Innumerable other examples\\ncould be given.', 'The explanation, I think, is simple: from long-continued\\nstudy they are strongly impressed with the differences between the\\nseveral races; and though they well know that each race varies slightly,\\nfor they win their prizes by selecting such slight differences, yet they\\nignore all general arguments, and refuse to sum up in their minds slight\\ndifferences accumulated during many successive generations.', 'May not\\nthose naturalists who, knowing far less of the laws of inheritance than\\ndoes the breeder, and knowing no more than he does of the intermediate\\nlinks in the long lines of descent, yet admit that many of our domestic\\nraces have descended from the same parents--may they not learn a lesson\\nof caution, when they deride the idea of species in a state of nature\\nbeing lineal descendants of other species?', 'SELECTION.', 'Let us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races have been\\nproduced, either from one or from several allied species.', 'Some little\\neffect may, perhaps, be attributed to the direct action of the external\\nconditions of life, and some little to habit; but he would be a bold\\nman who would account by such agencies for the differences of a dray and\\nrace horse, a greyhound and bloodhound, a carrier and tumbler pigeon.', \"One of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races is that we\\nsee in them adaptation, not indeed to the animal's or plant's own good,\\nbut to man's use or fancy.\", \"Some variations useful to him have probably\\narisen suddenly, or by one step; many botanists, for instance, believe\\nthat the fuller's teazle, with its hooks, which cannot be rivalled by\\nany mechanical contrivance, is only a variety of the wild Dipsacus; and\\nthis amount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling.\", 'So it has\\nprobably been with the turnspit dog; and this is known to have been\\nthe case with the ancon sheep.', 'But when we compare the dray-horse and\\nrace-horse, the dromedary and camel, the various breeds of sheep fitted\\neither for cultivated land or mountain pasture, with the wool of one\\nbreed good for one purpose, and that of another breed for another\\npurpose; when we compare the many breeds of dogs, each good for man in\\nvery different ways; when we compare the game-cock, so pertinacious\\nin battle, with other breeds so little quarrelsome, with \"everlasting\\nlayers\" which never desire to sit, and with the bantam so small and\\nelegant; when we compare the host of agricultural, culinary, orchard,\\nand flower-garden races of plants, most useful to man at different\\nseasons and for different purposes, or so beautiful in his eyes, we\\nmust, I think, look further than to mere variability.', 'We cannot suppose\\nthat all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as\\nwe now see them; indeed, in several cases, we know that this has not\\nbeen their history.', \"The key is man's power of accumulative selection:\\nnature gives successive variations; man adds them up in certain\\ndirections useful to him.\", 'In this sense he may be said to make for\\nhimself useful breeds.', 'The great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical.', 'It is certain that several of our eminent breeders have, even within a\\nsingle lifetime, modified to a large extent some breeds of cattle and\\nsheep.', 'In order fully to realise what they have done, it is almost\\nnecessary to read several of the many treatises devoted to this subject,\\nand to inspect the animals.', \"Breeders habitually speak of an animal's\\norganisation as something quite plastic, which they can model almost\\nas they please.\", 'If I had space I could quote numerous passages to this\\neffect from highly competent authorities.', 'Youatt, who was probably\\nbetter acquainted with the works of agriculturalists than almost any\\nother individual, and who was himself a very good judge of an animal,\\nspeaks of the principle of selection as \"that which enables the\\nagriculturist, not only to modify the character of his flock, but to\\nchange it altogether.', 'It is the magician\\'s wand, by means of which\\nhe may summon into life whatever form and mould he pleases.\"', 'Lord\\nSomerville, speaking of what breeders have done for sheep, says:--\"It\\nwould seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall a form perfect in\\nitself, and then had given it existence.\"', 'That most skilful breeder,\\nSir John Sebright, used to say, with respect to pigeons, that \"he would\\nproduce any given feather in three years, but it would take him\\nsix years to obtain head and beak.\"', 'In Saxony the importance of the\\nprinciple of selection in regard to merino sheep is so fully recognised,\\nthat men follow it as a trade: the sheep are placed on a table and are\\nstudied, like a picture by a connoisseur; this is done three times at\\nintervals of months, and the sheep are each time marked and classed, so\\nthat the very best may ultimately be selected for breeding.', 'What English breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous\\nprices given for animals with a good pedigree; and these have now been\\nexported to almost every quarter of the world.', 'The improvement is by no\\nmeans generally due to crossing different breeds; all the best breeders\\nare strongly opposed to this practice, except sometimes amongst closely\\nallied sub-breeds.', 'And when a cross has been made, the closest selection\\nis far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases.', 'If selection\\nconsisted merely in separating some very distinct variety, and breeding\\nfrom it, the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth\\nnotice; but its importance consists in the great effect produced by\\nthe accumulation in one direction, during successive generations, of\\ndifferences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye--differences\\nwhich I for one have vainly attempted to appreciate.', 'Not one man in\\na thousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an\\neminent breeder.', 'If gifted with these qualities, and he studies his\\nsubject for years, and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable\\nperseverance, he will succeed, and may make great improvements; if he\\nwants any of these qualities, he will assuredly fail.', 'Few would readily\\nbelieve in the natural capacity and years of practice requisite to\\nbecome even a skilful pigeon-fancier.', 'The same principles are followed by horticulturists; but the variations\\nare here often more abrupt.', 'No one supposes that our choicest\\nproductions have been produced by a single variation from the aboriginal\\nstock.', 'We have proofs that this is not so in some cases, in which exact\\nrecords have been kept; thus, to give a very trifling instance, the\\nsteadily-increasing size of the common gooseberry may be quoted.', \"We see\\nan astonishing improvement in many florists' flowers, when the flowers\\nof the present day are compared with drawings made only twenty or thirty\\nyears ago.\", 'When a race of plants is once pretty well established, the\\nseed-raisers do not pick out the best plants, but merely go over their\\nseed-beds, and pull up the \"rogues,\" as they call the plants that\\ndeviate from the proper standard.', 'With animals this kind of selection\\nis, in fact, also followed; for hardly any one is so careless as to\\nallow his worst animals to breed.', 'In regard to plants, there is another means of observing the accumulated\\neffects of selection--namely, by comparing the diversity of flowers in\\nthe different varieties of the same species in the flower-garden; the\\ndiversity of leaves, pods, or tubers, or whatever part is valued, in the\\nkitchen-garden, in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties;\\nand the diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard, in\\ncomparison with the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties.', 'See\\nhow different the leaves of the cabbage are, and how extremely alike the\\nflowers; how unlike the flowers of the heartsease are, and how alike the\\nleaves; how much the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ\\nin size, colour, shape, and hairiness, and yet the flowers present very\\nslight differences.', 'It is not that the varieties which differ largely\\nin some one point do not differ at all in other points; this is hardly\\never, perhaps never, the case.', 'The laws of correlation of growth,\\nthe importance of which should never be overlooked, will ensure some\\ndifferences; but, as a general rule, I cannot doubt that the continued\\nselection of slight variations, either in the leaves, the flowers, or\\nthe fruit, will produce races differing from each other chiefly in these\\ncharacters.', 'It may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to\\nmethodical practice for scarcely more than three-quarters of a century;\\nit has certainly been more attended to of late years, and many treatises\\nhave been published on the subject; and the result, I may add, has been,\\nin a corresponding degree, rapid and important.', 'But it is very far from\\ntrue that the principle is a modern discovery.', 'I could give several\\nreferences to the full acknowledgment of the importance of the principle\\nin works of high antiquity.', 'In rude and barbarous periods of English\\nhistory choice animals were often imported, and laws were passed to\\nprevent their exportation: the destruction of horses under a certain\\nsize was ordered, and this may be compared to the \"roguing\" of plants\\nby nurserymen.', 'The principle of selection I find distinctly given in an\\nancient Chinese encyclopaedia.', 'Explicit rules are laid down by some of\\nthe Roman classical writers.', 'From passages in Genesis, it is clear that\\nthe colour of domestic animals was at that early period attended to.', 'Savages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals, to\\nimprove the breed, and they formerly did so, as is attested by passages\\nin Pliny.', 'The savages in South Africa match their draught cattle by\\ncolour, as do some of the Esquimaux their teams of dogs.', 'Livingstone\\nshows how much good domestic breeds are valued by the negroes of the\\ninterior of Africa who have not associated with Europeans.', 'Some of these\\nfacts do not show actual selection, but they show that the breeding of\\ndomestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient times, and is now\\nattended to by the lowest savages.', 'It would, indeed, have been a strange\\nfact, had attention not been paid to breeding, for the inheritance of\\ngood and bad qualities is so obvious.', 'At the present time, eminent breeders try by methodical selection, with\\na distinct object in view, to make a new strain or sub-breed, superior\\nto anything existing in the country.', 'But, for our purpose, a kind of\\nSelection, which may be called Unconscious, and which results from every\\none trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals, is\\nmore important.', 'Thus, a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries\\nto get as good dogs as he can, and afterwards breeds from his own best\\ndogs, but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the\\nbreed.', 'Nevertheless I cannot doubt that this process, continued during\\ncenturies, would improve and modify any breed, in the same way as\\nBakewell, Collins, etc., by this very same process, only carried on more\\nmethodically, did greatly modify, even during their own lifetimes, the\\nforms and qualities of their cattle.', 'Slow and insensible changes of this\\nkind could never be recognised unless actual measurements or careful\\ndrawings of the breeds in question had been made long ago, which might\\nserve for comparison.', 'In some cases, however, unchanged or but little\\nchanged individuals of the same breed may be found in less civilised\\ndistricts, where the breed has been less improved.', \"There is reason to\\nbelieve that King Charles's spaniel has been unconsciously modified to\\na large extent since the time of that monarch.\", 'Some highly competent\\nauthorities are convinced that the setter is directly derived from the\\nspaniel, and has probably been slowly altered from it.', 'It is known that\\nthe English pointer has been greatly changed within the last century,\\nand in this case the change has, it is believed, been chiefly effected\\nby crosses with the fox-hound; but what concerns us is, that the change\\nhas been effected unconsciously and gradually, and yet so effectually,\\nthat, though the old Spanish pointer certainly came from Spain, Mr.', 'Borrow has not seen, as I am informed by him, any native dog in Spain\\nlike our pointer.', 'By a similar process of selection, and by careful training, the whole\\nbody of English racehorses have come to surpass in fleetness and size\\nthe parent Arab stock, so that the latter, by the regulations for the\\nGoodwood Races, are favoured in the weights they carry.', 'Lord Spencer and\\nothers have shown how the cattle of England have increased in weight\\nand in early maturity, compared with the stock formerly kept in this\\ncountry.', 'By comparing the accounts given in old pigeon treatises of\\ncarriers and tumblers with these breeds as now existing in Britain,\\nIndia, and Persia, we can, I think, clearly trace the stages through\\nwhich they have insensibly passed, and come to differ so greatly from\\nthe rock-pigeon.', 'Youatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a course of\\nselection, which may be considered as unconsciously followed, in so far\\nthat the breeders could never have expected or even have wished to have\\nproduced the result which ensued--namely, the production of two distinct\\nstrains.', 'The two flocks of Leicester sheep kept by Mr. Buckley and Mr.\\nBurgess, as Mr. Youatt remarks, \"have been purely bred from the original\\nstock of Mr. Bakewell for upwards of fifty years.', 'There is not a\\nsuspicion existing in the mind of any one at all acquainted with\\nthe subject that the owner of either of them has deviated in any one\\ninstance from the pure blood of Mr. Bakewell\\'s flock, and yet the\\ndifference between the sheep possessed by these two gentlemen is so\\ngreat that they have the appearance of being quite different varieties.\"', 'If there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited\\ncharacter of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet any one animal\\nparticularly useful to them, for any special purpose, would be carefully\\npreserved during famines and other accidents, to which savages are\\nso liable, and such choice animals would thus generally leave more\\noffspring than the inferior ones; so that in this case there would be a\\nkind of unconscious selection going on.', 'We see the value set on animals\\neven by the barbarians of Tierra del Fuego, by their killing and\\ndevouring their old women, in times of dearth, as of less value than\\ntheir dogs.', 'In plants the same gradual process of improvement, through the\\noccasional preservation of the best individuals, whether or not\\nsufficiently distinct to be ranked at their first appearance as distinct\\nvarieties, and whether or not two or more species or races have become\\nblended together by crossing, may plainly be recognised in the increased\\nsize and beauty which we now see in the varieties of the heartsease,\\nrose, pelargonium, dahlia, and other plants, when compared with the\\nolder varieties or with their parent-stocks.', 'No one would ever expect to\\nget a first-rate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of a wild plant.', 'No\\none would expect to raise a first-rate melting pear from the seed of a\\nwild pear, though he might succeed from a poor seedling growing wild,\\nif it had come from a garden-stock.', \"The pear, though cultivated in\\nclassical times, appears, from Pliny's description, to have been a\\nfruit of very inferior quality.\", 'I have seen great surprise expressed\\nin horticultural works at the wonderful skill of gardeners, in having\\nproduced such splendid results from such poor materials; but the art,\\nI cannot doubt, has been simple, and, as far as the final result is\\nconcerned, has been followed almost unconsciously.', 'It has consisted in\\nalways cultivating the best known variety, sowing its seeds, and, when\\na slightly better variety has chanced to appear, selecting it, and so\\nonwards.', 'But the gardeners of the classical period, who cultivated\\nthe best pear they could procure, never thought what splendid fruit we\\nshould eat; though we owe our excellent fruit, in some small degree,\\nto their having naturally chosen and preserved the best varieties they\\ncould anywhere find.', 'A large amount of change in our cultivated plants, thus slowly and\\nunconsciously accumulated, explains, as I believe, the well-known fact,\\nthat in a vast number of cases we cannot recognise, and therefore do\\nnot know, the wild parent-stocks of the plants which have been longest\\ncultivated in our flower and kitchen gardens.', 'If it has taken centuries\\nor thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to\\ntheir present standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how it\\nis that neither Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region\\ninhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth\\nculture.', 'It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by\\na strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but\\nthat the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up\\nto a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in\\ncountries anciently civilised.', 'In regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man, it should\\nnot be overlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their\\nown food, at least during certain seasons.', 'And in two countries very\\ndifferently circumstanced, individuals of the same species, having\\nslightly different constitutions or structure, would often succeed\\nbetter in the one country than in the other, and thus by a process of\\n\"natural selection,\" as will hereafter be more fully explained, two\\nsub-breeds might be formed.', 'This, perhaps, partly explains what has been\\nremarked by some authors, namely, that the varieties kept by savages\\nhave more of the character of species than the varieties kept in\\ncivilised countries.', \"On the view here given of the all-important part which selection by\\nman has played, it becomes at once obvious, how it is that our domestic\\nraces show adaptation in their structure or in their habits to man's\\nwants or fancies.\", 'We can, I think, further understand the frequently\\nabnormal character of our domestic races, and likewise their differences\\nbeing so great in external characters and relatively so slight in\\ninternal parts or organs.', 'Man can hardly select, or only with much\\ndifficulty, any deviation of structure excepting such as is externally\\nvisible; and indeed he rarely cares for what is internal.', 'He can never\\nact by selection, excepting on variations which are first given to\\nhim in some slight degree by nature.', 'No man would ever try to make\\na fantail, till he saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight\\ndegree in an unusual manner, or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a\\ncrop of somewhat unusual size; and the more abnormal or unusual any\\ncharacter was when it first appeared, the more likely it would be to\\ncatch his attention.', 'But to use such an expression as trying to make a\\nfantail, is, I have no doubt, in most cases, utterly incorrect.', 'The man\\nwho first selected a pigeon with a slightly larger tail, never dreamed\\nwhat the descendants of that pigeon would become through long-continued,\\npartly unconscious and partly methodical selection.', 'Perhaps the parent\\nbird of all fantails had only fourteen tail-feathers somewhat expanded,\\nlike the present Java fantail, or like individuals of other and distinct\\nbreeds, in which as many as seventeen tail-feathers have been counted.', 'Perhaps the first pouter-pigeon did not inflate its crop much more than\\nthe turbit now does the upper part of its oesophagus,--a habit which\\nis disregarded by all fanciers, as it is not one of the points of the\\nbreed.', \"Nor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would\\nbe necessary to catch the fancier's eye: he perceives extremely small\\ndifferences, and it is in human nature to value any novelty, however\\nslight, in one's own possession.\", 'Nor must the value which would formerly\\nbe set on any slight differences in the individuals of the same species,\\nbe judged of by the value which would now be set on them, after several\\nbreeds have once fairly been established.', 'Many slight differences might,\\nand indeed do now, arise amongst pigeons, which are rejected as faults\\nor deviations from the standard of perfection of each breed.', 'The common\\ngoose has not given rise to any marked varieties; hence the Thoulouse\\nand the common breed, which differ only in colour, that most fleeting of\\ncharacters, have lately been exhibited as distinct at our poultry-shows.', 'I think these views further explain what has sometimes been\\nnoticed--namely that we know nothing about the origin or history of\\nany of our domestic breeds.', 'But, in fact, a breed, like a dialect of\\na language, can hardly be said to have had a definite origin.', 'A man\\npreserves and breeds from an individual with some slight deviation of\\nstructure, or takes more care than usual in matching his best animals\\nand thus improves them, and the improved individuals slowly spread in\\nthe immediate neighbourhood.', 'But as yet they will hardly have a distinct\\nname, and from being only slightly valued, their history will be\\ndisregarded.', 'When further improved by the same slow and gradual process,\\nthey will spread more widely, and will get recognised as something\\ndistinct and valuable, and will then probably first receive a provincial\\nname.', 'In semi-civilised countries, with little free communication, the\\nspreading and knowledge of any new sub-breed will be a slow process.', 'As soon as the points of value of the new sub-breed are once fully\\nacknowledged, the principle, as I have called it, of unconscious\\nselection will always tend,--perhaps more at one period than at another,\\nas the breed rises or falls in fashion,--perhaps more in one district\\nthan in another, according to the state of civilisation of the\\ninhabitants--slowly to add to the characteristic features of the breed,\\nwhatever they may be.', 'But the chance will be infinitely small of any\\nrecord having been preserved of such slow, varying, and insensible\\nchanges.', \"I must now say a few words on the circumstances, favourable, or the\\nreverse, to man's power of selection.\", 'A high degree of variability is\\nobviously favourable, as freely giving the materials for selection to\\nwork on;

such breeds as we do\\nsometimes see are almost always imported from some other country, often\\nfrom islands.', 'Although I do not doubt that some domestic animals vary\\nless than others, yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds of the\\ncat, the donkey, peacock, goose, etc., may be attributed in main part\\nto selection not having been brought into play: in cats, from the\\ndifficulty in pairing them; in donkeys, from only a few being kept by\\npoor people, and little attention paid to their breeding; in peacocks,\\nfrom not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept; in geese,\\nfrom being valuable only for two purposes, food and feathers, and more\\nespecially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of distinct\\nbreeds.', 'To sum up on the origin of our Domestic Races of animals and plants.', 'I believe that the conditions of life, from their action on the\\nreproductive system, are so far of the highest importance as causing\\nvariability.', 'I do not believe that variability is an inherent and\\nnecessary contingency, under all circumstances, with all organic beings,\\nas some authors have thought.', 'The effects of variability are modified by\\nvarious degrees of inheritance and of reversion.', 'Variability is governed\\nby many unknown laws, more especially by that of correlation of growth.', 'Something may be attributed to the direct action of the conditions of\\nlife.', 'Something must be attributed to use and disuse.', 'The final result\\nis thus rendered infinitely complex.', 'In some cases, I do not doubt\\nthat the intercrossing of species, aboriginally distinct, has played an\\nimportant part in the origin of our domestic productions.', 'When in\\nany country several domestic breeds have once been established, their\\noccasional intercrossing, with the aid of selection, has, no doubt,\\nlargely aided in the formation of new sub-breeds;

but I could show by a long\\ncatalogue of facts, that parts which must be called important, whether\\nviewed under a physiological or classificatory point of view, sometimes\\nvary in the individuals of the same species.', 'I am convinced that the\\nmost experienced naturalist would be surprised at the number of the\\ncases of variability, even in important parts of structure, which he\\ncould collect on good authority, as I have collected, during a course of\\nyears.', 'It should be remembered that systematists are far from pleased at\\nfinding variability in important characters, and that there are not\\nmany men who will laboriously examine internal and important organs, and\\ncompare them in many specimens of the same species.', 'I should never\\nhave expected that the branching of the main nerves close to the great\\ncentral ganglion of an insect would have been variable in the same\\nspecies; I should have expected that changes of this nature could have\\nbeen effected only by slow degrees: yet quite recently Mr. Lubbock has\\nshown a degree of variability in these main nerves in Coccus, which may\\nalmost be compared to the irregular branching of the stem of a tree.', 'This philosophical naturalist, I may add, has also quite recently shown\\nthat the muscles in the larvae of certain insects are very far from\\nuniform.', 'Authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state that\\nimportant organs never vary;

for as long, as far as\\nwe know, as have good and true species.', 'Practically, when a naturalist\\ncan unite two forms together by others having intermediate characters,\\nhe treats the one as a variety of the other, ranking the most common,\\nbut sometimes the one first described, as the species, and the other\\nas the variety.', 'But cases of great difficulty, which I will not here\\nenumerate, sometimes occur in deciding whether or not to rank one\\nform as a variety of another, even when they are closely connected by\\nintermediate links;

they have a different flavour and emit a different\\nodour; they flower at slightly different periods; they grow in somewhat\\ndifferent stations; they ascend mountains to different heights; they\\nhave different geographical ranges;

yet a German author makes more than a dozen species out\\nof forms, which are very generally considered as varieties; and in\\nthis country the highest botanical authorities and practical men can be\\nquoted to show that the sessile and pedunculated oaks are either good\\nand distinct species or mere varieties.', 'When a young naturalist commences the study of a group of organisms\\nquite unknown to him, he is at first much perplexed to determine what\\ndifferences to consider as specific, and what as varieties; for he\\nknows nothing of the amount and kind of variation to which the group\\nis subject; and this shows, at least, how very generally there is some\\nvariation.', 'But if he confine his attention to one class within one\\ncountry, he will soon make up his mind how to rank most of the doubtful\\nforms.', 'His general tendency will be to make many species, for he will\\nbecome impressed, just like the pigeon or poultry-fancier before alluded\\nto, with the amount of difference in the forms which he is continually\\nstudying; and he has little general knowledge of analogical variation\\nin other groups and in other countries, by which to correct his first\\nimpressions.', 'As he extends the range of his observations, he will meet\\nwith more cases of difficulty; for he will encounter a greater number\\nof closely-allied forms.', 'But if his observations be widely extended, he\\nwill in the end generally be enabled to make up his own mind which to\\ncall varieties and which species;

and at these latter, as leading to\\nsub-species, and to species.', 'The passage from one stage of difference\\nto another and higher stage may be, in some cases, due merely to the\\nlong-continued action of different physical conditions in two different\\nregions; but I have not much faith in this view; and I attribute the\\npassage of a variety, from a state in which it differs very slightly\\nfrom its parent to one in which it differs more, to the action of\\nnatural selection in accumulating (as will hereafter be more fully\\nexplained) differences of structure in certain definite directions.', 'Hence I believe a well-marked variety may be justly called an incipient\\nspecies; but whether this belief be justifiable must be judged of by\\nthe general weight of the several facts and views given throughout this\\nwork.', 'It need not be supposed that all varieties or incipient species\\nnecessarily attain the rank of species.', 'They may whilst in this\\nincipient state become extinct, or they may endure as varieties for very\\nlong periods, as has been shown to be the case by Mr. Wollaston with the\\nvarieties of certain fossil land-shells in Madeira.', 'If a variety were\\nto flourish so as to exceed in numbers the parent species, it would then\\nrank as the species, and the species as the variety; or it might come to\\nsupplant and exterminate the parent species; or both might co-exist, and\\nboth rank as independent species.', 'But we shall hereafter have to return\\nto this subject.', 'From these remarks it will be seen that I look at the term species,\\nas one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of\\nindividuals closely resembling each other, and that it does not\\nessentially differ from the term variety, which is given to less\\ndistinct and more fluctuating forms.', 'The term variety, again,\\nin comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied\\narbitrarily, and for mere convenience sake.', 'Guided by theoretical considerations, I thought that some interesting\\nresults might be obtained in regard to the nature and relations of the\\nspecies which vary most, by tabulating all the varieties in several\\nwell-worked floras.', 'At first this seemed a simple task; but Mr. H. C.\\nWatson, to whom I am much indebted for valuable advice and assistance\\non this subject, soon convinced me that there were many difficulties, as\\ndid subsequently Dr. Hooker, even in stronger terms.', 'I shall reserve\\nfor my future work the discussion of these difficulties, and the tables\\nthemselves of the proportional numbers of the varying species.', 'Dr. Hooker permits me to add, that after having carefully read my\\nmanuscript, and examined the tables, he thinks that the following\\nstatements are fairly well established.', 'The whole subject, however,\\ntreated as it necessarily here is with much brevity, is rather\\nperplexing, and allusions cannot be avoided to the \"struggle for\\nexistence,\" \"divergence of character,\" and other questions, hereafter to\\nbe discussed.', 'Alph.', 'De Candolle and others have shown that plants which have very wide\\nranges generally present varieties; and this might have been expected,\\nas they become exposed to diverse physical conditions, and as they\\ncome into competition (which, as we shall hereafter see, is a far more\\nimportant circumstance) with different sets of organic beings.', 'But my\\ntables further show that, in any limited country, the species which are\\nmost common, that is abound most in individuals, and the species\\nwhich are most widely diffused within their own country (and this is a\\ndifferent consideration from wide range, and to a certain extent from\\ncommonness), often give rise to varieties sufficiently well-marked to\\nhave been recorded in botanical works.', 'Hence it is the most flourishing,\\nor, as they may be called, the dominant species,--those which range\\nwidely over the world, are the most diffused in their own country,\\nand are the most numerous in individuals,--which oftenest produce\\nwell-marked varieties, or, as I consider them, incipient species.', 'And\\nthis, perhaps, might have been anticipated; for, as varieties, in order\\nto become in any degree permanent, necessarily have to struggle with the\\nother inhabitants of the country, the species which are already dominant\\nwill be the most likely to yield offspring which, though in some slight\\ndegree modified, will still inherit those advantages that enabled their\\nparents to become dominant over their compatriots.', 'If the plants inhabiting a country and described in any Flora be divided\\ninto two equal masses, all those in the larger genera being placed\\non one side, and all those in the smaller genera on the other side, a\\nsomewhat larger number of the very common and much diffused or dominant\\nspecies will be found on the side of the larger genera.', 'This, again,\\nmight have been anticipated; for the mere fact of many species of the\\nsame genus inhabiting any country, shows that there is something in the\\norganic or inorganic conditions of that country favourable to the genus;\\nand, consequently, we might have expected to have found in the larger\\ngenera, or those including many species, a large proportional number of\\ndominant species.', 'But so many causes tend to obscure this result, that\\nI am surprised that my tables show even a small majority on the side of\\nthe larger genera.', 'I will here allude to only two causes of obscurity.', 'Fresh-water and salt-loving plants have generally very wide ranges and\\nare much diffused, but this seems to be connected with the nature of the\\nstations inhabited by them, and has little or no relation to the size of\\nthe genera to which the species belong.', 'Again, plants low in the scale\\nof organisation are generally much more widely diffused than plants\\nhigher in the scale; and here again there is no close relation to the\\nsize of the genera.', 'The cause of lowly-organised plants ranging widely\\nwill be discussed in our chapter on geographical distribution.', 'From looking at species as only strongly-marked and well-defined\\nvarieties, I was led to anticipate that the species of the larger genera\\nin each country would oftener present varieties, than the species of the\\nsmaller genera; for wherever many closely related species (i.e.', 'species\\nof the same genus) have been formed, many varieties or incipient species\\nought, as a general rule, to be now forming.', 'Where many large trees\\ngrow, we expect to find saplings.', 'Where many species of a genus have\\nbeen formed through variation, circumstances have been favourable\\nfor variation; and hence we might expect that the circumstances would\\ngenerally be still favourable to variation.', 'On the other hand, if we\\nlook at each species as a special act of creation, there is no apparent\\nreason why more varieties should occur in a group having many species,\\nthan in one having few.', 'To test the truth of this anticipation I have arranged the plants of\\ntwelve countries, and the coleopterous insects of two districts, into\\ntwo nearly equal masses, the species of the larger genera on one side,\\nand those of the smaller genera on the other side, and it has invariably\\nproved to be the case that a larger proportion of the species on the\\nside of the larger genera present varieties, than on the side of the\\nsmaller genera.', 'Moreover, the species of the large genera which present\\nany varieties, invariably present a larger average number of varieties\\nthan do the species of the small genera.', 'Both these results follow when\\nanother division is made, and when all the smallest genera, with from\\nonly one to four species, are absolutely excluded from the tables.', 'These facts are of plain signification on the view that species are only\\nstrongly marked and permanent varieties; for wherever many species of\\nthe same genus have been formed, or where, if we may use the expression,\\nthe manufactory of species has been active, we ought generally to find\\nthe manufactory still in action, more especially as we have every reason\\nto believe the process of manufacturing new species to be a slow one.', 'And this certainly is the case, if varieties be looked at as incipient\\nspecies; for my tables clearly show as a general rule that, wherever\\nmany species of a genus have been formed, the species of that genus\\npresent a number of varieties, that is of incipient species, beyond the\\naverage.', 'It is not that all large genera are now varying much, and are\\nthus increasing in the number of their species, or that no small genera\\nare now varying and increasing; for if this had been so, it would have\\nbeen fatal to my theory; inasmuch as geology plainly tells us that small\\ngenera have in the lapse of time often increased greatly in size;\\nand that large genera have often come to their maxima, declined, and\\ndisappeared.', 'All that we want to show is, that where many species of a\\ngenus have been formed, on an average many are still forming; and this\\nholds good.', 'There are other relations between the species of large genera and their\\nrecorded varieties which deserve notice.', 'We have seen that there is no\\ninfallible criterion by which to distinguish species and well-marked\\nvarieties; and in those cases in which intermediate links have not been\\nfound between doubtful forms, naturalists are compelled to come to\\na determination by the amount of difference between them, judging by\\nanalogy whether or not the amount suffices to raise one or both to the\\nrank of species.', 'Hence the amount of difference is one very important\\ncriterion in settling whether two forms should be ranked as species or\\nvarieties.', 'Now Fries has remarked in regard to plants, and Westwood in\\nregard to insects, that in large genera the amount of difference between\\nthe species is often exceedingly small.', 'I have endeavoured to test this\\nnumerically by averages, and, as far as my imperfect results go, they\\nalways confirm the view.', 'I have also consulted some sagacious and most\\nexperienced observers, and, after deliberation, they concur in this\\nview.', 'In this respect, therefore, the species of the larger genera\\nresemble varieties, more than do the species of the smaller genera.', 'Or the case may be put in another way, and it may be said, that in\\nthe larger genera, in which a number of varieties or incipient species\\ngreater than the average are now manufacturing, many of the species\\nalready manufactured still to a certain extent resemble varieties, for\\nthey differ from each other by a less than usual amount of difference.', 'Moreover, the species of the large genera are related to each other, in\\nthe same manner as the varieties of any one species are related to\\neach other.', 'No naturalist pretends that all the species of a genus are\\nequally distinct from each other; they may generally be divided into\\nsub-genera, or sections, or lesser groups.', 'As Fries has well remarked,\\nlittle groups of species are generally clustered like satellites around\\ncertain other species.', 'And what are varieties but groups of forms,\\nunequally related to each other, and clustered round certain forms--that\\nis, round their parent-species?', 'Undoubtedly there is one most important\\npoint of difference between varieties and species; namely, that the\\namount of difference between varieties, when compared with each other or\\nwith their parent-species, is much less than that between the species of\\nthe same genus.', 'But when we come to discuss the principle, as I call it,\\nof Divergence of Character, we shall see how this may be explained, and\\nhow the lesser differences between varieties will tend to increase into\\nthe greater differences between species.', 'There is one other point which seems to me worth notice.', 'Varieties\\ngenerally have much restricted ranges: this statement is indeed scarcely\\nmore than a truism, for if a variety were found to have a wider range\\nthan that of its supposed parent-species, their denominations ought to\\nbe reversed.', 'But there is also reason to believe, that those species\\nwhich are very closely allied to other species, and in so far resemble\\nvarieties, often have much restricted ranges.', 'For instance, Mr. H. C.\\nWatson has marked for me in the well-sifted London Catalogue of plants\\n(4th edition) 63 plants which are therein ranked as species, but which\\nhe considers as so closely allied to other species as to be of doubtful\\nvalue: these 63 reputed species range on an average over 6.9 of the\\nprovinces into which Mr. Watson has divided Great Britain.', 'Now, in this\\nsame catalogue, 53 acknowledged varieties are recorded, and these range\\nover 7.7 provinces; whereas, the species to which these varieties belong\\nrange over 14.3 provinces.', 'So that the acknowledged varieties have very\\nnearly the same restricted average range, as have those very closely\\nallied forms, marked for me by Mr. Watson as doubtful species, but which\\nare almost universally ranked by British botanists as good and true\\nspecies.', 'Finally, then, varieties have the same general characters as species,\\nfor they cannot be distinguished from species,--except, firstly, by\\nthe discovery of intermediate linking forms, and the occurrence of\\nsuch links cannot affect the actual characters of the forms which they\\nconnect; and except, secondly, by a certain amount of difference, for\\ntwo forms, if differing very little, are generally ranked as varieties,\\nnotwithstanding that intermediate linking forms have not been\\ndiscovered; but the amount of difference considered necessary to give to\\ntwo forms the rank of species is quite indefinite.', 'In genera having more\\nthan the average number of species in any country, the species of these\\ngenera have more than the average number of varieties.', 'In large genera\\nthe species are apt to be closely, but unequally, allied together,\\nforming little clusters round certain species.', 'Species very closely\\nallied to other species apparently have restricted ranges.', 'In all these\\nseveral respects the species of large genera present a strong analogy\\nwith varieties.', 'And we can clearly understand these analogies, if\\nspecies have once existed as varieties, and have thus originated:\\nwhereas, these analogies are utterly inexplicable if each species has\\nbeen independently created.', 'We have, also, seen that it is the most flourishing and dominant species\\nof the larger genera which on an average vary most; and varieties, as\\nwe shall hereafter see, tend to become converted into new and distinct\\nspecies.', 'The larger genera thus tend to become larger; and throughout\\nnature the forms of life which are now dominant tend to become still\\nmore dominant by leaving many modified and dominant descendants.', 'But by\\nsteps hereafter to be explained, the larger genera also tend to break up\\ninto smaller genera.', 'And thus, the forms of life throughout the universe\\nbecome divided into groups subordinate to groups.', '3.', 'STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE.', 'Bears on natural selection.', 'The term used in a wide sense.', 'Geometrical\\npowers of increase.', 'Rapid increase of naturalised animals and plants.', 'Nature of the checks to increase.', 'Competition universal.', 'Effects of\\nclimate.', 'Protection from the number of individuals.', 'Complex relations of\\nall animals and plants throughout nature.', 'Struggle for life most severe\\nbetween individuals and varieties of the same species;

indeed I am not aware that this has ever been disputed.', 'It is immaterial for us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be called\\nspecies or sub-species or varieties; what rank, for instance, the two or\\nthree hundred doubtful forms of British plants are entitled to hold,\\nif the existence of any well-marked varieties be admitted.', 'But the\\nmere existence of individual variability and of some few well-marked\\nvarieties, though necessary as the foundation for the work, helps us but\\nlittle in understanding how species arise in nature.', 'How have all those\\nexquisite adaptations of one part of the organisation to another part,\\nand to the conditions of life, and of one distinct organic being to\\nanother being, been perfected?', 'We see these beautiful co-adaptations\\nmost plainly in the woodpecker and missletoe; and only a little\\nless plainly in the humblest parasite which clings to the hairs of a\\nquadruped or feathers of a bird; in the structure of the beetle which\\ndives through the water; in the plumed seed which is wafted by the\\ngentlest breeze; in short, we see beautiful adaptations everywhere and\\nin every part of the organic world.', 'Again, it may be asked, how is it that varieties, which I have called\\nincipient species, become ultimately converted into good and distinct\\nspecies, which in most cases obviously differ from each other far\\nmore than do the varieties of the same species?', 'How do those groups of\\nspecies, which constitute what are called distinct genera, and which\\ndiffer from each other more than do the species of the same genus,\\narise?', 'All these results, as we shall more fully see in the next\\nchapter, follow inevitably from the struggle for life.', 'Owing to this\\nstruggle for life, any variation, however slight and from whatever cause\\nproceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of any\\nspecies, in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and\\nto external nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual,\\nand will generally be inherited by its offspring.', 'The offspring,\\nalso, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of the many\\nindividuals of any species which are periodically born, but a small\\nnumber can survive.', \"I have called this principle, by which each slight\\nvariation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of Natural Selection,\\nin order to mark its relation to man's power of selection.\", 'We have seen\\nthat man by selection can certainly produce great results, and can adapt\\norganic beings to his own uses, through the accumulation of slight\\nbut useful variations, given to him by the hand of Nature.', \"But Natural\\nSelection, as we shall hereafter see, is a power incessantly ready for\\naction, and is as immeasurably superior to man's feeble efforts, as the\\nworks of Nature are to those of Art.\", 'We will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for existence.', 'In my future work this subject shall be treated, as it well deserves,\\nat much greater length.', 'The elder De Candolle and Lyell have largely\\nand philosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed to severe\\ncompetition.', 'In regard to plants, no one has treated this subject with\\nmore spirit and ability than W.

for instance, on a piece of ground three feet long and two\\nwide, dug and cleared, and where there could be no choking from other\\nplants, I marked all the seedlings of our native weeds as they came up,\\nand out of the 357 no less than 295 were destroyed, chiefly by slugs\\nand insects.', 'If turf which has long been mown, and the case would be the\\nsame with turf closely browsed by quadrupeds, be let to grow, the more\\nvigorous plants gradually kill the less vigorous, though fully grown,\\nplants: thus out of twenty species growing on a little plot of turf\\n(three feet by four) nine species perished from the other species being\\nallowed to grow up freely.', 'The amount of food for each species of course gives the extreme limit\\nto which each can increase; but very frequently it is not the obtaining\\nfood, but the serving as prey to other animals, which determines the\\naverage numbers of a species.', 'Thus, there seems to be little doubt that\\nthe stock of partridges, grouse, and hares on any large estate depends\\nchiefly on the destruction of vermin.', 'If not one head of game were shot\\nduring the next twenty years in England, and, at the same time, if no\\nvermin were destroyed, there would, in all probability, be less game\\nthan at present, although hundreds of thousands of game animals are now\\nannually killed.', 'On the other hand, in some cases, as with the elephant\\nand rhinoceros, none are destroyed by beasts of prey: even the tiger in\\nIndia most rarely dares to attack a young elephant protected by its dam.', 'Climate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of a\\nspecies, and periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought, I believe\\nto be the most effective of all checks.', 'I estimated that the winter of\\n1854-55 destroyed four-fifths of the birds in my own grounds; and this\\nis a tremendous destruction, when we remember that ten per cent.', 'is an\\nextraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics with man.', 'The action of\\nclimate seems at first sight to be quite independent of the struggle for\\nexistence; but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food, it\\nbrings on the most severe struggle between the individuals, whether of\\nthe same or of distinct species, which subsist on the same kind of food.', 'Even when climate, for instance extreme cold, acts directly, it will\\nbe the least vigorous, or those which have got least food through the\\nadvancing winter, which will suffer most.', 'When we travel from south to\\nnorth, or from a damp region to a dry, we invariably see some species\\ngradually getting rarer and rarer, and finally disappearing; and the\\nchange of climate being conspicuous, we are tempted to attribute the\\nwhole effect to its direct action.', 'But this is a very false view: we\\nforget that each species, even where it most abounds, is constantly\\nsuffering enormous destruction at some period of its life, from enemies\\nor from competitors for the same place and food; and if these enemies\\nor competitors be in the least degree favoured by any slight change of\\nclimate, they will increase in numbers, and, as each area is already\\nfully stocked with inhabitants, the other species will decrease.', 'When\\nwe travel southward and see a species decreasing in numbers, we may feel\\nsure that the cause lies quite as much in other species being favoured,\\nas in this one being hurt.', 'So it is when we travel northward, but in\\na somewhat lesser degree, for the number of species of all kinds,\\nand therefore of competitors, decreases northwards; hence in going\\nnorthward, or in ascending a mountain, we far oftener meet with stunted\\nforms, due to the DIRECTLY injurious action of climate, than we do in\\nproceeding southwards or in descending a mountain.', 'When we reach\\nthe Arctic regions, or snow-capped summits, or absolute deserts, the\\nstruggle for life is almost exclusively with the elements.', 'That climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other species, we\\nmay clearly see in the prodigious number of plants in our gardens\\nwhich can perfectly well endure our climate, but which never become\\nnaturalised, for they cannot compete with our native plants, nor resist\\ndestruction by our native animals.', 'When a species, owing to highly favourable circumstances, increases\\ninordinately in numbers in a small tract, epidemics--at least, this\\nseems generally to occur with our game animals--often ensue: and here\\nwe have a limiting check independent of the struggle for life.', 'But even\\nsome of these so-called epidemics appear to be due to parasitic worms,\\nwhich have from some cause, possibly in part through facility of\\ndiffusion amongst the crowded animals, been disproportionably favoured:\\nand here comes in a sort of struggle between the parasite and its prey.', 'On the other hand, in many cases, a large stock of individuals of the\\nsame species, relatively to the numbers of its enemies, is absolutely\\nnecessary for its preservation.', 'Thus we can easily raise plenty of\\ncorn and rape-seed, etc., in our fields, because the seeds are in great\\nexcess compared with the number of birds which feed on them; nor can\\nthe birds, though having a superabundance of food at this one season,\\nincrease in number proportionally to the supply of seed, as their\\nnumbers are checked during winter: but any one who has tried, knows how\\ntroublesome it is to get seed from a few wheat or other such plants in\\na garden; I have in this case lost every single seed.', 'This view of the\\nnecessity of a large stock of the same species for its preservation,\\nexplains, I believe, some singular facts in nature, such as that of very\\nrare plants being sometimes extremely abundant in the few spots where\\nthey do occur; and that of some social plants being social, that is,\\nabounding in individuals, even on the extreme confines of their range.', 'For in such cases, we may believe, that a plant could exist only where\\nthe conditions of its life were so favourable that many could exist\\ntogether, and thus save each other from utter destruction.', 'I should add\\nthat the good effects of frequent intercrossing, and the ill effects of\\nclose interbreeding, probably come into play in some of these cases; but\\non this intricate subject I will not here enlarge.', 'Many cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are the\\nchecks and relations between organic beings, which have to struggle\\ntogether in the same country.', 'I will give only a single instance, which,\\nthough a simple one, has interested me.', 'In Staffordshire, on the estate\\nof a relation where I had ample means of investigation, there was a\\nlarge and extremely barren heath, which had never been touched by the\\nhand of man; but several hundred acres of exactly the same nature had\\nbeen enclosed twenty-five years previously and planted with Scotch fir.', 'The change in the native vegetation of the planted part of the heath was\\nmost remarkable, more than is generally seen in passing from one quite\\ndifferent soil to another: not only the proportional numbers of the\\nheath-plants were wholly changed, but twelve species of plants (not\\ncounting grasses and carices) flourished in the plantations, which could\\nnot be found on the heath.', 'The effect on the insects must have been\\nstill greater, for six insectivorous birds were very common in the\\nplantations, which were not to be seen on the heath; and the heath was\\nfrequented by two or three distinct insectivorous birds.', 'Here we see how\\npotent has been the effect of the introduction of a single tree, nothing\\nwhatever else having been done, with the exception that the land had\\nbeen enclosed, so that cattle could not enter.', 'But how important an\\nelement enclosure is, I plainly saw near Farnham, in Surrey.', 'Here\\nthere are extensive heaths, with a few clumps of old Scotch firs on\\nthe distant hill-tops: within the last ten years large spaces have been\\nenclosed, and self-sown firs are now springing up in multitudes, so\\nclose together that all cannot live.', 'When I ascertained that these young trees had not been sown or planted,\\nI was so much surprised at their numbers that I went to several points\\nof view, whence I could examine hundreds of acres of the unenclosed\\nheath, and literally I could not see a single Scotch fir, except the old\\nplanted clumps.', 'But on looking closely between the stems of the heath,\\nI found a multitude of seedlings and little trees, which had been\\nperpetually browsed down by the cattle.', 'In one square yard, at a\\npoint some hundred yards distant from one of the old clumps, I counted\\nthirty-two little trees; and one of them, judging from the rings of\\ngrowth, had during twenty-six years tried to raise its head above the\\nstems of the heath, and had failed.', 'No wonder that, as soon as the land\\nwas enclosed, it became thickly clothed with vigorously growing young\\nfirs.', 'Yet the heath was so extremely barren and so extensive that no\\none would ever have imagined that cattle would have so closely and\\neffectually searched it for food.', 'Here we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the Scotch\\nfir; but in several parts of the world insects determine the existence\\nof cattle.', 'Perhaps Paraguay offers the most curious instance of this;\\nfor here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild, though\\nthey swarm southward and northward in a feral state; and Azara and\\nRengger have shown that this is caused by the greater number in Paraguay\\nof a certain fly, which lays its eggs in the navels of these animals\\nwhen first born.', 'The increase of these flies, numerous as they are,\\nmust be habitually checked by some means, probably by birds.', 'Hence, if\\ncertain insectivorous birds (whose numbers are probably regulated by\\nhawks or beasts of prey) were to increase in Paraguay, the flies would\\ndecrease--then cattle and horses would become feral, and this would\\ncertainly greatly alter (as indeed I have observed in parts of South\\nAmerica) the vegetation: this again would largely affect the insects;\\nand this, as we just have seen in Staffordshire, the insectivorous\\nbirds, and so onwards in ever-increasing circles of complexity.', 'We began\\nthis series by insectivorous birds, and we have ended with them.', 'Not\\nthat in nature the relations can ever be as simple as this.', 'Battle\\nwithin battle must ever be recurring with varying success;

male\\nalligators have been described as fighting, bellowing, and whirling\\nround, like Indians in a war-dance, for the possession of the females;\\nmale salmons have been seen fighting all day long; male stag-beetles\\noften bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other males.', 'The war is,\\nperhaps, severest between the males of polygamous animals, and these\\nseem oftenest provided with special weapons.', 'The males of carnivorous\\nanimals are already well armed; though to them and to others, special\\nmeans of defence may be given through means of sexual selection, as the\\nmane to the lion, the shoulder-pad to the boar, and the hooked jaw to\\nthe male salmon; for the shield may be as important for victory, as the\\nsword or spear.', 'Amongst birds, the contest is often of a more peaceful character.', 'All those who have attended to the subject, believe that there is the\\nseverest rivalry between the males of many species to attract by singing\\nthe females.', 'The rock-thrush of Guiana, birds of Paradise, and some\\nothers, congregate; and successive males display their gorgeous plumage\\nand perform strange antics before the females, which standing by as\\nspectators, at last choose the most attractive partner.', 'Those who have\\nclosely attended to birds in confinement well know that they often take\\nindividual preferences and dislikes: thus Sir R. Heron has described how\\none pied peacock was eminently attractive to all his hen birds.', 'It may\\nappear childish to attribute any effect to such apparently weak means: I\\ncannot here enter on the details necessary to support this view; but if\\nman can in a short time give elegant carriage and beauty to his bantams,\\naccording to his standard of beauty, I can see no good reason to doubt\\nthat female birds, by selecting, during thousands of generations,\\nthe most melodious or beautiful males, according to their standard of\\nbeauty, might produce a marked effect.', 'I strongly suspect that some\\nwell-known laws with respect to the plumage of male and female birds, in\\ncomparison with the plumage of the young, can be explained on the view\\nof plumage having been chiefly modified by sexual selection, acting when\\nthe birds have come to the breeding age or during the breeding season;\\nthe modifications thus produced being inherited at corresponding ages or\\nseasons, either by the males alone, or by the males and females; but I\\nhave not space here to enter on this subject.', 'Thus it is, as I believe, that when the males and females of any animal\\nhave the same general habits of life, but differ in structure, colour,\\nor ornament, such differences have been mainly caused by sexual\\nselection; that is, individual males have had, in successive\\ngenerations, some slight advantage over other males, in their weapons,\\nmeans of defence, or charms; and have transmitted these advantages to\\ntheir male offspring.', 'Yet, I would not wish to attribute all such\\nsexual differences to this agency: for we see peculiarities arising and\\nbecoming attached to the male sex in our domestic animals (as the wattle\\nin male carriers, horn-like protuberances in the cocks of certain fowls,\\netc.', '), which we cannot believe to be either useful to the males in\\nbattle, or attractive to the females.', 'We see analogous cases under\\nnature, for instance, the tuft of hair on the breast of the turkey-cock,\\nwhich can hardly be either useful or ornamental to this bird;--indeed,\\nhad the tuft appeared under domestication, it would have been called a\\nmonstrosity.', 'ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE ACTION OF NATURAL SELECTION.', 'In order to make it clear how, as I believe, natural selection acts, I\\nmust beg permission to give one or two imaginary illustrations.', 'Let us\\ntake the case of a wolf, which preys on various animals, securing some\\nby craft, some by strength, and some by fleetness; and let us suppose\\nthat the fleetest prey, a deer for instance, had from any change in\\nthe country increased in numbers, or that other prey had decreased in\\nnumbers, during that season of the year when the wolf is hardest pressed\\nfor food.', 'I can under such circumstances see no reason to doubt that the\\nswiftest and slimmest wolves would have the best chance of surviving,\\nand so be preserved or selected,--provided always that they retained\\nstrength to master their prey at this or at some other period of the\\nyear, when they might be compelled to prey on other animals.', 'I can see\\nno more reason to doubt this, than that man can improve the fleetness\\nof his greyhounds by careful and methodical selection, or by that\\nunconscious selection which results from each man trying to keep the\\nbest dogs without any thought of modifying the breed.', 'Even without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals on\\nwhich our wolf preyed, a cub might be born with an innate tendency to\\npursue certain kinds of prey.', 'Nor can this be thought very improbable;\\nfor we often observe great differences in the natural tendencies of our\\ndomestic animals; one cat, for instance, taking to catch rats, another\\nmice; one cat, according to Mr. St. John, bringing home winged game,\\nanother hares or rabbits, and another hunting on marshy ground and\\nalmost nightly catching woodcocks or snipes.', 'The tendency to catch rats\\nrather than mice is known to be inherited.', 'Now, if any slight innate\\nchange of habit or of structure benefited an individual wolf, it would\\nhave the best chance of surviving and of leaving offspring.', 'Some of its\\nyoung would probably inherit the same habits or structure, and by the\\nrepetition of this process, a new variety might be formed which would\\neither supplant or coexist with the parent-form of wolf.', 'Or, again,\\nthe wolves inhabiting a mountainous district, and those frequenting the\\nlowlands, would naturally be forced to hunt different prey; and from the\\ncontinued preservation of the individuals best fitted for the two sites,\\ntwo varieties might slowly be formed.', 'These varieties would cross and\\nblend where they met; but to this subject of intercrossing we shall soon\\nhave to return.', \"I may add, that, according to Mr. Pierce, there are two\\nvarieties of the wolf inhabiting the Catskill Mountains in the United\\nStates, one with a light greyhound-like form, which pursues deer, and\\nthe other more bulky, with shorter legs, which more frequently attacks\\nthe shepherd's flocks.\", 'Let us now take a more complex case.', 'Certain plants excrete a sweet\\njuice, apparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from\\ntheir sap: this is effected by glands at the base of the stipules in\\nsome Leguminosae, and at the back of the leaf of the common laurel.', 'This\\njuice, though small in quantity, is greedily sought by insects.', 'Let us\\nnow suppose a little sweet juice or nectar to be excreted by the inner\\nbases of the petals of a flower.', 'In this case insects in seeking the\\nnectar would get dusted with pollen, and would certainly often transport\\nthe pollen from one flower to the stigma of another flower.', 'The flowers\\nof two distinct individuals of the same species would thus get crossed;\\nand the act of crossing, we have good reason to believe (as will\\nhereafter be more fully alluded to), would produce very vigorous\\nseedlings, which consequently would have the best chance of flourishing\\nand surviving.', 'Some of these seedlings would probably inherit the\\nnectar-excreting power.', 'Those individual flowers which had the largest\\nglands or nectaries, and which excreted most nectar, would be oftenest\\nvisited by insects, and would be oftenest crossed; and so in the\\nlong-run would gain the upper hand.', 'Those flowers, also, which had their\\nstamens and pistils placed, in relation to the size and habits of the\\nparticular insects which visited them, so as to favour in any degree\\nthe transportal of their pollen from flower to flower, would likewise be\\nfavoured or selected.', 'We might have taken the case of insects visiting\\nflowers for the sake of collecting pollen instead of nectar; and as\\npollen is formed for the sole object of fertilisation, its destruction\\nappears a simple loss to the plant; yet if a little pollen were carried,\\nat first occasionally and then habitually, by the pollen-devouring\\ninsects from flower to flower, and a cross thus effected, although\\nnine-tenths of the pollen were destroyed, it might still be a great gain\\nto the plant; and those individuals which produced more and more pollen,\\nand had larger and larger anthers, would be selected.', 'When our plant, by this process of the continued preservation or natural\\nselection of more and more attractive flowers, had been rendered highly\\nattractive to insects, they would, unintentionally on their part,\\nregularly carry pollen from flower to flower; and that they can most\\neffectually do this, I could easily show by many striking instances.', 'I will give only one--not as a very striking case, but as likewise\\nillustrating one step in the separation of the sexes of plants,\\npresently to be alluded to.', 'Some holly-trees bear only male flowers,\\nwhich have four stamens producing rather a small quantity of pollen, and\\na rudimentary pistil; other holly-trees bear only female flowers; these\\nhave a full-sized pistil, and four stamens with shrivelled anthers, in\\nwhich not a grain of pollen can be detected.', 'Having found a female\\ntree exactly sixty yards from a male tree, I put the stigmas of twenty\\nflowers, taken from different branches, under the microscope, and\\non all, without exception, there were pollen-grains, and on some a\\nprofusion of pollen.', 'As the wind had set for several days from the\\nfemale to the male tree, the pollen could not thus have been carried.', 'The weather had been cold and boisterous, and therefore not favourable\\nto bees, nevertheless every female flower which I examined had been\\neffectually fertilised by the bees, accidentally dusted with pollen,\\nhaving flown from tree to tree in search of nectar.', 'But to return to\\nour imaginary case: as soon as the plant had been rendered so highly\\nattractive to insects that pollen was regularly carried from flower\\nto flower, another process might commence.', 'No naturalist doubts the\\nadvantage of what has been called the \"physiological division of\\nlabour;\" hence we may believe that it would be advantageous to a plant\\nto produce stamens alone in one flower or on one whole plant, and\\npistils alone in another flower or on another plant.', 'In plants under\\nculture and placed under new conditions of life, sometimes the male\\norgans and sometimes the female organs become more or less impotent;\\nnow if we suppose this to occur in ever so slight a degree under nature,\\nthen as pollen is already carried regularly from flower to flower,\\nand as a more complete separation of the sexes of our plant would be\\nadvantageous on the principle of the division of labour, individuals\\nwith this tendency more and more increased, would be continually\\nfavoured or selected, until at last a complete separation of the sexes\\nwould be effected.', 'Let us now turn to the nectar-feeding insects in our imaginary case: we\\nmay suppose the plant of which we have been slowly increasing the nectar\\nby continued selection, to be a common plant; and that certain insects\\ndepended in main part on its nectar for food.', 'I could give many facts,\\nshowing how anxious bees are to save time; for instance, their habit of\\ncutting holes and sucking the nectar at the bases of certain flowers,\\nwhich they can, with a very little more trouble, enter by the mouth.', 'Bearing such facts in mind, I can see no reason to doubt that an\\naccidental deviation in the size and form of the body, or in the\\ncurvature and length of the proboscis, etc., far too slight to be\\nappreciated by us, might profit a bee or other insect, so that an\\nindividual so characterised would be able to obtain its food more\\nquickly, and so have a better chance of living and leaving descendants.', 'Its descendants would probably inherit a tendency to a similar slight\\ndeviation of structure.', 'The tubes of the corollas of the common red and\\nincarnate clovers (Trifolium pratense and incarnatum) do not on a hasty\\nglance appear to differ in length; yet the hive-bee can easily suck\\nthe nectar out of the incarnate clover, but not out of the common red\\nclover, which is visited by humble-bees alone; so that whole fields of\\nthe red clover offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to\\nthe hive-bee.', 'Thus it might be a great advantage to the hive-bee to have\\na slightly longer or differently constructed proboscis.', 'On the other\\nhand, I have found by experiment that the fertility of clover greatly\\ndepends on bees visiting and moving parts of the corolla, so as to push\\nthe pollen on to the stigmatic surface.', 'Hence, again, if humble-bees\\nwere to become rare in any country, it might be a great advantage to the\\nred clover to have a shorter or more deeply divided tube to its corolla,\\nso that the hive-bee could visit its flowers.', 'Thus I can understand how\\na flower and a bee might slowly become, either simultaneously or one\\nafter the other, modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to each\\nother, by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutual\\nand slightly favourable deviations of structure.', 'I am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection, exemplified in\\nthe above imaginary instances, is open to the same objections which were\\nat first urged against Sir Charles Lyell\\'s noble views on \"the modern\\nchanges of the earth, as illustrative of geology;\" but we now very\\nseldom hear the action, for instance, of the coast-waves, called a\\ntrifling and insignificant cause, when applied to the excavation of\\ngigantic valleys or to the formation of the longest lines of inland\\ncliffs.', 'Natural selection can act only by the preservation and\\naccumulation of infinitesimally small inherited modifications, each\\nprofitable to the preserved being; and as modern geology has almost\\nbanished such views as the excavation of a great valley by a single\\ndiluvial wave, so will natural selection, if it be a true principle,\\nbanish the belief of the continued creation of new organic beings, or of\\nany great and sudden modification in their structure.', 'ON THE INTERCROSSING OF INDIVIDUALS.', 'I must here introduce a short digression.', 'In the case of animals\\nand plants with separated sexes, it is of course obvious that two\\nindividuals must always unite for each birth; but in the case of\\nhermaphrodites this is far from obvious.', 'Nevertheless I am strongly\\ninclined to believe that with all hermaphrodites two individuals, either\\noccasionally or habitually, concur for the reproduction of their kind.', 'This view, I may add, was first suggested by Andrew Knight.', 'We shall\\npresently see its importance; but I must here treat the subject with\\nextreme brevity, though I have the materials prepared for an ample\\ndiscussion.', 'All vertebrate animals, all insects, and some other large\\ngroups of animals, pair for each birth.', 'Modern research has much\\ndiminished the number of supposed hermaphrodites, and of real\\nhermaphrodites a large number pair; that is, two individuals regularly\\nunite for reproduction, which is all that concerns us.', 'But still there\\nare many hermaphrodite animals which certainly do not habitually pair,\\nand a vast majority of plants are hermaphrodites.', 'What reason, it may be\\nasked, is there for supposing in these cases that two individuals ever\\nconcur in reproduction?', 'As it is impossible here to enter on details, I\\nmust trust to some general considerations alone.', 'In the first place, I have collected so large a body of facts, showing,\\nin accordance with the almost universal belief of breeders, that with\\nanimals and plants a cross between different varieties, or between\\nindividuals of the same variety but of another strain, gives vigour\\nand fertility to the offspring; and on the other hand, that CLOSE\\ninterbreeding diminishes vigour and fertility; that these facts alone\\nincline me to believe that it is a general law of nature (utterly\\nignorant though we be of the meaning of the law) that no organic being\\nself-fertilises itself for an eternity of generations; but that a\\ncross with another individual is occasionally--perhaps at very long\\nintervals--indispensable.', 'On the belief that this is a law of nature, we can, I think, understand\\nseveral large classes of facts, such as the following, which on any\\nother view are inexplicable.', 'Every hybridizer knows how unfavourable\\nexposure to wet is to the fertilisation of a flower, yet what a\\nmultitude of flowers have their anthers and stigmas fully exposed to\\nthe weather!', \"but if an occasional cross be indispensable, the fullest\\nfreedom for the entrance of pollen from another individual will explain\\nthis state of exposure, more especially as the plant's own anthers and\\npistil generally stand so close together that self-fertilisation seems\\nalmost inevitable.\", \"Many flowers, on the other hand, have their organs\\nof fructification closely enclosed, as in the great papilionaceous or\\npea-family; but in several, perhaps in all, such flowers, there is a\\nvery curious adaptation between the structure of the flower and the\\nmanner in which bees suck the nectar; for, in doing this, they either\\npush the flower's own pollen on the stigma, or bring pollen from another\\nflower.\", 'So necessary are the visits of bees to papilionaceous flowers,\\nthat I have found, by experiments published elsewhere, that their\\nfertility is greatly diminished if these visits be prevented.', 'Now, it\\nis scarcely possible that bees should fly from flower to flower, and not\\ncarry pollen from one to the other, to the great good, as I believe,\\nof the plant.', \"Bees will act like a camel-hair pencil, and it is quite\\nsufficient just to touch the anthers of one flower and then the stigma\\nof another with the same brush to ensure fertilisation; but it must not\\nbe supposed that bees would thus produce a multitude of hybrids between\\ndistinct species; for if you bring on the same brush a plant's own\\npollen and pollen from another species, the former will have such a\\nprepotent effect, that it will invariably and completely destroy, as has\\nbeen shown by Gartner, any influence from the foreign pollen.\", 'When the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil, or\\nslowly move one after the other towards it, the contrivance seems\\nadapted solely to ensure self-fertilisation; and no doubt it is useful\\nfor this end: but, the agency of insects is often required to cause the\\nstamens to spring forward, as Kolreuter has shown to be the case with\\nthe barberry; and curiously in this very genus, which seems to have a\\nspecial contrivance for self-fertilisation, it is well known that if\\nvery closely-allied forms or varieties are planted near each other, it\\nis hardly possible to raise pure seedlings, so largely do they\\nnaturally cross.', 'In many other cases, far from there being any aids for\\nself-fertilisation, there are special contrivances, as I could show\\nfrom the writings of C. C. Sprengel and from my own observations, which\\neffectually prevent the stigma receiving pollen from its own flower: for\\ninstance, in Lobelia fulgens, there is a really beautiful and\\nelaborate contrivance by which every one of the infinitely numerous\\npollen-granules are swept out of the conjoined anthers of each flower,\\nbefore the stigma of that individual flower is ready to receive them;\\nand as this flower is never visited, at least in my garden, by insects,\\nit never sets a seed, though by placing pollen from one flower on the\\nstigma of another, I raised plenty of seedlings; and whilst another\\nspecies of Lobelia growing close by, which is visited by bees, seeds\\nfreely.', 'In very many other cases, though there be no special mechanical\\ncontrivance to prevent the stigma of a flower receiving its own pollen,\\nyet, as C. C. Sprengel has shown, and as I can confirm, either the\\nanthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation, or the\\nstigma is ready before the pollen of that flower is ready, so that these\\nplants have in fact separated sexes, and must habitually be crossed.', 'How strange are these facts!', 'How strange that the pollen and stigmatic\\nsurface of the same flower, though placed so close together, as if\\nfor the very purpose of self-fertilisation, should in so many cases be\\nmutually useless to each other!', 'How simply are these facts explained\\non the view of an occasional cross with a distinct individual being\\nadvantageous or indispensable!', 'If several varieties of the cabbage, radish, onion, and of some other\\nplants, be allowed to seed near each other, a large majority, as I\\nhave found, of the seedlings thus raised will turn out mongrels: for\\ninstance, I raised 233 seedling cabbages from some plants of different\\nvarieties growing near each other, and of these only 78 were true to\\ntheir kind, and some even of these were not perfectly true.', 'Yet the\\npistil of each cabbage-flower is surrounded not only by its own six\\nstamens, but by those of the many other flowers on the same plant.', 'How,\\nthen, comes it that such a vast number of the seedlings are mongrelized?', \"I suspect that it must arise from the pollen of a distinct VARIETY\\nhaving a prepotent effect over a flower's own pollen; and that this is\\npart of the general law of good being derived from the intercrossing\\nof distinct individuals of the same species.\", \"When distinct SPECIES are\\ncrossed the case is directly the reverse, for a plant's own pollen\\nis always prepotent over foreign pollen; but to this subject we shall\\nreturn in a future chapter.\", 'In the case of a gigantic tree covered with innumerable flowers, it may\\nbe objected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree to tree, and\\nat most only from flower to flower on the same tree, and that flowers\\non the same tree can be considered as distinct individuals only in a\\nlimited sense.', 'I believe this objection to be valid, but that nature has\\nlargely provided against it by giving to trees a strong tendency to bear\\nflowers with separated sexes.', 'When the sexes are separated, although\\nthe male and female flowers may be produced on the same tree, we can see\\nthat pollen must be regularly carried from flower to flower; and this\\nwill give a better chance of pollen being occasionally carried from tree\\nto tree.', 'That trees belonging to all Orders have their sexes more often\\nseparated than other plants, I find to be the case in this country; and\\nat my request Dr. Hooker tabulated the trees of New Zealand, and Dr. Asa\\nGray those of the United States, and the result was as I anticipated.', 'On\\nthe other hand, Dr. Hooker has recently informed me that he finds that\\nthe rule does not hold in Australia; and I have made these few remarks\\non the sexes of trees simply to call attention to the subject.', 'Turning for a very brief space to animals: on the land there are some\\nhermaphrodites, as land-mollusca and earth-worms; but these all pair.', 'As yet I have not found a single case of a terrestrial animal which\\nfertilises itself.', 'We can understand this remarkable fact, which\\noffers so strong a contrast with terrestrial plants, on the view of an\\noccasional cross being indispensable, by considering the medium in which\\nterrestrial animals live, and the nature of the fertilising element; for\\nwe know of no means, analogous to the action of insects and of the wind\\nin the case of plants, by which an occasional cross could be effected\\nwith terrestrial animals without the concurrence of two individuals.', 'Of aquatic animals, there are many self-fertilising hermaphrodites;\\nbut here currents in the water offer an obvious means for an occasional\\ncross.', 'And, as in the case of flowers, I have as yet failed, after\\nconsultation with one of the highest authorities, namely, Professor\\nHuxley, to discover a single case of an hermaphrodite animal with the\\norgans of reproduction so perfectly enclosed within the body, that\\naccess from without and the occasional influence of a distinct\\nindividual can be shown to be physically impossible.', 'Cirripedes long\\nappeared to me to present a case of very great difficulty under this\\npoint of view; but I have been enabled, by a fortunate chance, elsewhere\\nto prove that two individuals, though both are self-fertilising\\nhermaphrodites, do sometimes cross.', 'It must have struck most naturalists as a strange anomaly that, in the\\ncase of both animals and plants, species of the same family and even of\\nthe same genus, though agreeing closely with each other in almost their\\nwhole organisation, yet are not rarely, some of them hermaphrodites,\\nand some of them unisexual.', 'But if, in fact, all hermaphrodites do\\noccasionally intercross with other individuals, the difference between\\nhermaphrodites and unisexual species, as far as function is concerned,\\nbecomes very small.', 'From these several considerations and from the many special facts which\\nI have collected, but which I am not here able to give, I am strongly\\ninclined to suspect that, both in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, an\\noccasional intercross with a distinct individual is a law of nature.', 'I\\nam well aware that there are, on this view, many cases of difficulty,\\nsome of which I am trying to investigate.', 'Finally then, we may conclude\\nthat in many organic beings, a cross between two individuals is an\\nobvious necessity for each birth; in many others it occurs perhaps only\\nat long intervals; but in none, as I suspect, can self-fertilisation go\\non for perpetuity.', 'CIRCUMSTANCES FAVOURABLE TO NATURAL SELECTION.', 'This is an extremely intricate subject.', 'A large amount of inheritable\\nand diversified variability is favourable, but I believe mere individual\\ndifferences suffice for the work.', 'A large number of individuals, by\\ngiving a better chance for the appearance within any given period\\nof profitable variations, will compensate for a lesser amount of\\nvariability in each individual, and is, I believe, an extremely\\nimportant element of success.', 'Though nature grants vast periods of time\\nfor the work of natural selection, she does not grant an indefinite\\nperiod; for as all organic beings are striving, it may be said, to seize\\non each place in the economy of nature, if any one species does\\nnot become modified and improved in a corresponding degree with its\\ncompetitors, it will soon be exterminated.', \"In man's methodical selection, a breeder selects for some definite\\nobject, and free intercrossing will wholly stop his work.\", 'But when many\\nmen, without intending to alter the breed, have a nearly common standard\\nof perfection, and all try to get and breed from the best animals,\\nmuch improvement and modification surely but slowly follow from this\\nunconscious process of selection, notwithstanding a large amount of\\ncrossing with inferior animals.', 'Thus it will be in nature; for within a\\nconfined area, with some place in its polity not so perfectly occupied\\nas might be, natural selection will always tend to preserve all the\\nindividuals varying in the right direction, though in different degrees,\\nso as better to fill up the unoccupied place.', 'But if the area be large,\\nits several districts will almost certainly present different conditions\\nof life; and then if natural selection be modifying and improving a\\nspecies in the several districts, there will be intercrossing with the\\nother individuals of the same species on the confines of each.', 'And in\\nthis case the effects of intercrossing can hardly be counterbalanced by\\nnatural selection always tending to modify all the individuals in each\\ndistrict in exactly the same manner to the conditions of each; for in a\\ncontinuous area, the conditions will generally graduate away insensibly\\nfrom one district to another.', 'The intercrossing will most affect those\\nanimals which unite for each birth, which wander much, and which do\\nnot breed at a very quick rate.', 'Hence in animals of this nature, for\\ninstance in birds, varieties will generally be confined to separated\\ncountries; and this I believe to be the case.', 'In hermaphrodite organisms\\nwhich cross only occasionally, and likewise in animals which unite for\\neach birth, but which wander little and which can increase at a very\\nrapid rate, a new and improved variety might be quickly formed on any\\none spot, and might there maintain itself in a body, so that whatever\\nintercrossing took place would be chiefly between the individuals of\\nthe same new variety.', 'A local variety when once thus formed might\\nsubsequently slowly spread to other districts.', 'On the above principle,\\nnurserymen always prefer getting seed from a large body of plants of\\nthe same variety, as the chance of intercrossing with other varieties is\\nthus lessened.', 'Even in the case of slow-breeding animals, which unite for each birth,\\nwe must not overrate the effects of intercrosses in retarding natural\\nselection; for I can bring a considerable catalogue of facts, showing\\nthat within the same area, varieties of the same animal can long remain\\ndistinct, from haunting different stations, from breeding at slightly\\ndifferent seasons, or from varieties of the same kind preferring to pair\\ntogether.', 'Intercrossing plays a very important part in nature in keeping the\\nindividuals of the same species, or of the same variety, true and\\nuniform in character.', 'It will obviously thus act far more efficiently\\nwith those animals which unite for each birth; but I have already\\nattempted to show that we have reason to believe that occasional\\nintercrosses take place with all animals and with all plants.', 'Even if\\nthese take place only at long intervals, I am convinced that the\\nyoung thus produced will gain so much in vigour and fertility over the\\noffspring from long-continued self-fertilisation, that they will have a\\nbetter chance of surviving and propagating their kind; and thus, in the\\nlong run, the influence of intercrosses, even at rare intervals, will be\\ngreat.', 'If there exist organic beings which never intercross, uniformity\\nof character can be retained amongst them, as long as their conditions\\nof life remain the same, only through the principle of inheritance, and\\nthrough natural selection destroying any which depart from the\\nproper type; but if their conditions of life change and they undergo\\nmodification, uniformity of character can be given to their modified\\noffspring, solely by natural selection preserving the same favourable\\nvariations.', 'Isolation, also, is an important element in the process of natural\\nselection.', 'In a confined or isolated area, if not very large, the\\norganic and inorganic conditions of life will generally be in a great\\ndegree uniform; so that natural selection will tend to modify all the\\nindividuals of a varying species throughout the area in the same\\nmanner in relation to the same conditions.', 'Intercrosses, also, with the\\nindividuals of the same species, which otherwise would have inhabited\\nthe surrounding and differently circumstanced districts, will be\\nprevented.', 'But isolation probably acts more efficiently in checking the\\nimmigration of better adapted organisms, after any physical change, such\\nas of climate or elevation of the land, etc.', '; and thus new places in the\\nnatural economy of the country are left open for the old inhabitants\\nto struggle for, and become adapted to, through modifications in their\\nstructure and constitution.', 'Lastly, isolation, by checking immigration\\nand consequently competition, will give time for any new variety to\\nbe slowly improved; and this may sometimes be of importance in the\\nproduction of new species.', 'If, however, an isolated area be very small,\\neither from being surrounded by barriers, or from having very peculiar\\nphysical conditions, the total number of the individuals supported on it\\nwill necessarily be very small; and fewness of individuals will greatly\\nretard the production of new species through natural selection, by\\ndecreasing the chance of the appearance of favourable variations.', 'If we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks, and look at\\nany small isolated area, such as an oceanic island, although the total\\nnumber of the species inhabiting it, will be found to be small, as we\\nshall see in our chapter on geographical distribution; yet of these\\nspecies a very large proportion are endemic,--that is, have been\\nproduced there, and nowhere else.', 'Hence an oceanic island at first sight\\nseems to have been highly favourable for the production of new species.', 'But we may thus greatly deceive ourselves, for to ascertain whether a\\nsmall isolated area, or a large open area like a continent, has been\\nmost favourable for the production of new organic forms, we ought to\\nmake the comparison within equal times; and this we are incapable of\\ndoing.', 'Although I do not doubt that isolation is of considerable importance\\nin the production of new species, on the whole I am inclined to believe\\nthat largeness of area is of more importance, more especially in the\\nproduction of species, which will prove capable of enduring for a long\\nperiod, and of spreading widely.', 'Throughout a great and open area, not\\nonly will there be a better chance of favourable variations arising from\\nthe large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but\\nthe conditions of life are infinitely complex from the large number\\nof already existing species; and if some of these many species\\nbecome modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a\\ncorresponding degree or they will be exterminated.', 'Each new form, also,\\nas soon as it has been much improved, will be able to spread over the\\nopen and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many\\nothers.', 'Hence more new places will be formed, and the competition to\\nfill them will be more severe, on a large than on a small and\\nisolated area.', 'Moreover, great areas, though now continuous, owing to\\noscillations of level, will often have recently existed in a broken\\ncondition, so that the good effects of isolation will generally, to a\\ncertain extent, have concurred.', 'Finally, I conclude that, although small\\nisolated areas probably have been in some respects highly favourable for\\nthe production of new species, yet that the course of modification\\nwill generally have been more rapid on large areas; and what is more\\nimportant, that the new forms produced on large areas, which already\\nhave been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will\\nspread most widely, will give rise to most new varieties and species,\\nand will thus play an important part in the changing history of the\\norganic world.', 'We can, perhaps, on these views, understand some facts which will\\nbe again alluded to in our chapter on geographical distribution; for\\ninstance, that the productions of the smaller continent of Australia\\nhave formerly yielded, and apparently are now yielding, before those\\nof the larger Europaeo-Asiatic area.', 'Thus, also, it is that continental\\nproductions have everywhere become so largely naturalised on islands.', 'On\\na small island, the race for life will have been less severe, and there\\nwill have been less modification and less extermination.', 'Hence, perhaps,\\nit comes that the flora of Madeira, according to Oswald Heer, resembles\\nthe extinct tertiary flora of Europe.', 'All fresh-water basins, taken\\ntogether, make a small area compared with that of the sea or of the\\nland; and, consequently, the competition between fresh-water productions\\nwill have been less severe than elsewhere; new forms will have been\\nmore slowly formed, and old forms more slowly exterminated.', 'And it is\\nin fresh water that we find seven genera of Ganoid fishes, remnants of\\na once preponderant order: and in fresh water we find some of the most\\nanomalous forms now known in the world, as the Ornithorhynchus and\\nLepidosiren, which, like fossils, connect to a certain extent orders now\\nwidely separated in the natural scale.', 'These anomalous forms may almost\\nbe called living fossils; they have endured to the present day, from\\nhaving inhabited a confined area, and from having thus been exposed to\\nless severe competition.', 'To sum up the circumstances favourable and unfavourable to natural\\nselection, as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits.', 'I\\nconclude, looking to the future, that for terrestrial productions a\\nlarge continental area, which will probably undergo many oscillations\\nof level, and which consequently will exist for long periods in a broken\\ncondition, will be the most favourable for the production of many new\\nforms of life, likely to endure long and to spread widely.', 'For the area\\nwill first have existed as a continent, and the inhabitants, at this\\nperiod numerous in individuals and kinds, will have been subjected\\nto very severe competition.', 'When converted by subsidence into large\\nseparate islands, there will still exist many individuals of the same\\nspecies on each island: intercrossing on the confines of the range of\\neach species will thus be checked: after physical changes of any kind,\\nimmigration will be prevented, so that new places in the polity of\\neach island will have to be filled up by modifications of the old\\ninhabitants; and time will be allowed for the varieties in each to\\nbecome well modified and perfected.', 'When, by renewed elevation, the\\nislands shall be re-converted into a continental area, there will again\\nbe severe competition: the most favoured or improved varieties will be\\nenabled to spread: there will be much extinction of the less improved\\nforms, and the relative proportional numbers of the various inhabitants\\nof the renewed continent will again be changed; and again there will\\nbe a fair field for natural selection to improve still further the\\ninhabitants, and thus produce new species.', 'That natural selection will always act with extreme slowness, I fully\\nadmit.', 'Its action depends on there being places in the polity of nature,\\nwhich can be better occupied by some of the inhabitants of the country\\nundergoing modification of some kind.', 'The existence of such places will\\noften depend on physical changes, which are generally very slow, and\\non the immigration of better adapted forms having been checked.', 'But the\\naction of natural selection will probably still oftener depend on some\\nof the inhabitants becoming slowly modified; the mutual relations of\\nmany of the other inhabitants being thus disturbed.', 'Nothing can be\\neffected, unless favourable variations occur, and variation itself is\\napparently always a very slow process.', 'The process will often be greatly\\nretarded by free intercrossing.', 'Many will exclaim that these several\\ncauses are amply sufficient wholly to stop the action of natural\\nselection.', 'I do not believe so.', 'On the other hand, I do believe that\\nnatural selection will always act very slowly, often only at long\\nintervals of time, and generally on only a very few of the inhabitants\\nof the same region at the same time.', 'I further believe, that this very\\nslow, intermittent action of natural selection accords perfectly\\nwell with what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the\\ninhabitants of this world have changed.', \"Slow though the process of selection may be, if feeble man can do much\\nby his powers of artificial selection, I can see no limit to the amount\\nof change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations\\nbetween all organic beings, one with another and with their physical\\nconditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by\\nnature's power of selection.\", 'EXTINCTION.', 'This subject will be more fully discussed in our chapter on Geology; but\\nit must be here alluded to from being intimately connected with natural\\nselection.', 'Natural selection acts solely through the preservation of\\nvariations in some way advantageous, which consequently endure.', 'But as\\nfrom the high geometrical powers of increase of all organic beings, each\\narea is already fully stocked with inhabitants, it follows that as\\neach selected and favoured form increases in number, so will the less\\nfavoured forms decrease and become rare.', 'Rarity, as geology tells us, is\\nthe precursor to extinction.', 'We can, also, see that any form represented\\nby few individuals will, during fluctuations in the seasons or in the\\nnumber of its enemies, run a good chance of utter extinction.', 'But we may\\ngo further than this; for as new forms are continually and slowly being\\nproduced, unless we believe that the number of specific forms goes on\\nperpetually and almost indefinitely increasing, numbers inevitably must\\nbecome extinct.', 'That the number of specific forms has not indefinitely\\nincreased, geology shows us plainly; and indeed we can see reason why\\nthey should not have thus increased, for the number of places in the\\npolity of nature is not indefinitely great,--not that we have any means\\nof knowing that any one region has as yet got its maximum of species.', 'Probably no region is as yet fully stocked, for at the Cape of Good\\nHope, where more species of plants are crowded together than in any\\nother quarter of the world, some foreign plants have become naturalised,\\nwithout causing, as far as we know, the extinction of any natives.', 'Furthermore, the species which are most numerous in individuals will\\nhave the best chance of producing within any given period favourable\\nvariations.', 'We have evidence of this, in the facts given in the second\\nchapter, showing that it is the common species which afford the greatest\\nnumber of recorded varieties, or incipient species.', 'Hence, rare species\\nwill be less quickly modified or improved within any given period, and\\nthey will consequently be beaten in the race for life by the modified\\ndescendants of the commoner species.', 'From these several considerations I think it inevitably follows, that as\\nnew species in the course of time are formed through natural selection,\\nothers will become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct.', 'The forms which\\nstand in closest competition with those undergoing modification and\\nimprovement, will naturally suffer most.', 'And we have seen in the\\nchapter on the Struggle for Existence that it is the most closely-allied\\nforms,--varieties of the same species, and species of the same genus\\nor of related genera,--which, from having nearly the same structure,\\nconstitution, and habits, generally come into the severest competition\\nwith each other.', 'Consequently, each new variety or species, during the\\nprogress of its formation, will generally press hardest on its nearest\\nkindred, and tend to exterminate them.', 'We see the same process of\\nextermination amongst our domesticated productions, through the\\nselection of improved forms by man.', 'Many curious instances could\\nbe given showing how quickly new breeds of cattle, sheep, and other\\nanimals, and varieties of flowers, take the place of older and inferior\\nkinds.', 'In Yorkshire, it is historically known that the ancient black\\ncattle were displaced by the long-horns, and that these \"were swept away\\nby the short-horns\" (I quote the words of an agricultural writer) \"as if\\nby some murderous pestilence.\"', 'DIVERGENCE OF CHARACTER.', 'The principle, which I have designated by this term, is of high\\nimportance on my theory, and explains, as I believe, several important\\nfacts.', 'In the first place, varieties, even strongly-marked ones, though\\nhaving somewhat of the character of species--as is shown by the hopeless\\ndoubts in many cases how to rank them--yet certainly differ from\\neach other far less than do good and distinct species.', 'Nevertheless,\\naccording to my view, varieties are species in the process of formation,\\nor are, as I have called them, incipient species.', 'How, then, does the\\nlesser difference between varieties become augmented into the greater\\ndifference between species?', 'That this does habitually happen, we must\\ninfer from most of the innumerable species throughout nature presenting\\nwell-marked differences; whereas varieties, the supposed prototypes and\\nparents of future well-marked species, present slight and ill-defined\\ndifferences.', 'Mere chance, as we may call it, might cause one variety\\nto differ in some character from its parents, and the offspring of this\\nvariety again to differ from its parent in the very same character and\\nin a greater degree; but this alone would never account for so habitual\\nand large an amount of difference as that between varieties of the same\\nspecies and species of the same genus.', 'As has always been my practice, let us seek light on this head from our\\ndomestic productions.', 'We shall here find something analogous.', 'A fancier\\nis struck by a pigeon having a slightly shorter beak; another fancier is\\nstruck by a pigeon having a rather longer beak; and on the acknowledged\\nprinciple that \"fanciers do not and will not admire a medium standard,\\nbut like extremes,\" they both go on (as has actually occurred with\\ntumbler-pigeons) choosing and breeding from birds with longer and longer\\nbeaks, or with shorter and shorter beaks.', 'Again, we may suppose that at\\nan early period one man preferred swifter horses; another stronger and\\nmore bulky horses.', 'The early differences would be very slight; in the\\ncourse of time, from the continued selection of swifter horses by some\\nbreeders, and of stronger ones by others, the differences would become\\ngreater, and would be noted as forming two sub-breeds; finally, after\\nthe lapse of centuries, the sub-breeds would become converted into two\\nwell-established and distinct breeds.', 'As the differences slowly become\\ngreater, the inferior animals with intermediate characters, being\\nneither very swift nor very strong, will have been neglected, and will\\nhave tended to disappear.', \"Here, then, we see in man's productions\\nthe action of what may be called the principle of divergence, causing\\ndifferences, at first barely appreciable, steadily to increase, and\\nthe breeds to diverge in character both from each other and from their\\ncommon parent.\", 'But how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in nature?', 'I believe it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple\\ncircumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one\\nspecies become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will\\nthey be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in\\nthe polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers.', 'We can clearly see this in the case of animals with simple habits.', 'Take\\nthe case of a carnivorous quadruped, of which the number that can be\\nsupported in any country has long ago arrived at its full average.', 'If\\nits natural powers of increase be allowed to act, it can succeed in\\nincreasing (the country not undergoing any change in its conditions)\\nonly by its varying descendants seizing on places at present occupied by\\nother animals: some of them, for instance, being enabled to feed on\\nnew kinds of prey, either dead or alive; some inhabiting new stations,\\nclimbing trees, frequenting water, and some perhaps becoming less\\ncarnivorous.', 'The more diversified in habits and structure the\\ndescendants of our carnivorous animal became, the more places they would\\nbe enabled to occupy.', 'What applies to one animal will apply throughout\\nall time to all animals--that is, if they vary--for otherwise natural\\nselection can do nothing.', 'So it will be with plants.', 'It has been\\nexperimentally proved, that if a plot of ground be sown with one species\\nof grass, and a similar plot be sown with several distinct genera of\\ngrasses, a greater number of plants and a greater weight of dry herbage\\ncan thus be raised.', 'The same has been found to hold good when first\\none variety and then several mixed varieties of wheat have been sown on\\nequal spaces of ground.', 'Hence, if any one species of grass were to go\\non varying, and those varieties were continually selected which differed\\nfrom each other in at all the same manner as distinct species and genera\\nof grasses differ from each other, a greater number of individual plants\\nof this species of grass, including its modified descendants, would\\nsucceed in living on the same piece of ground.', 'And we well know that\\neach species and each variety of grass is annually sowing almost\\ncountless seeds; and thus, as it may be said, is striving its utmost to\\nincrease its numbers.', 'Consequently, I cannot doubt that in the course\\nof many thousands of generations, the most distinct varieties of any one\\nspecies of grass would always have the best chance of succeeding and\\nof increasing in numbers, and thus of supplanting the less distinct\\nvarieties; and varieties, when rendered very distinct from each other,\\ntake the rank of species.', 'The truth of the principle, that the greatest amount of life can be\\nsupported by great diversification of structure, is seen under many\\nnatural circumstances.', 'In an extremely small area, especially if freely\\nopen to immigration, and where the contest between individual and\\nindividual must be severe, we always find great diversity in its\\ninhabitants.', 'For instance, I found that a piece of turf, three feet by\\nfour in size, which had been exposed for many years to exactly the same\\nconditions, supported twenty species of plants, and these belonged to\\neighteen genera and to eight orders, which shows how much these plants\\ndiffered from each other.', 'So it is with the plants and insects on small\\nand uniform islets; and so in small ponds of fresh water.', 'Farmers find\\nthat they can raise most food by a rotation of plants belonging to the\\nmost different orders: nature follows what may be called a simultaneous\\nrotation.', 'Most of the animals and plants which live close round any\\nsmall piece of ground, could live on it (supposing it not to be in\\nany way peculiar in its nature), and may be said to be striving to the\\nutmost to live there; but, it is seen, that where they come into the\\nclosest competition with each other, the advantages of diversification\\nof structure, with the accompanying differences of habit and\\nconstitution, determine that the inhabitants, which thus jostle each\\nother most closely, shall, as a general rule, belong to what we call\\ndifferent genera and orders.', \"The same principle is seen in the naturalisation of plants through man's\\nagency in foreign lands.\", 'It might have been expected that the plants\\nwhich have succeeded in becoming naturalised in any land would generally\\nhave been closely allied to the indigenes; for these are commonly looked\\nat as specially created and adapted for their own country.', 'It might,\\nalso, perhaps have been expected that naturalised plants would have\\nbelonged to a few groups more especially adapted to certain stations in\\ntheir new homes.', 'But the case is very different; and Alph.', 'De Candolle\\nhas well remarked in his great and admirable work, that floras gain by\\nnaturalisation, proportionally with the number of the native genera and\\nspecies, far more in new genera than in new species.', \"To give a single\\ninstance: in the last edition of Dr. Asa Gray's 'Manual of the Flora of\\nthe Northern United States,' 260 naturalised plants are enumerated, and\\nthese belong to 162 genera.\", 'We thus see that these naturalised plants\\nare of a highly diversified nature.', 'They differ, moreover, to a large\\nextent from the indigenes, for out of the 162 genera, no less than 100\\ngenera are not there indigenous, and thus a large proportional addition\\nis made to the genera of these States.', 'By considering the nature of the plants or animals which have struggled\\nsuccessfully with the indigenes of any country, and have there become\\nnaturalised, we can gain some crude idea in what manner some of the\\nnatives would have had to be modified, in order to have gained an\\nadvantage over the other natives; and we may, I think, at least safely\\ninfer that diversification of structure, amounting to new generic\\ndifferences, would have been profitable to them.', 'The advantage of diversification in the inhabitants of the same region\\nis, in fact, the same as that of the physiological division of labour in\\nthe organs of the same individual body--a subject so well elucidated by\\nMilne Edwards.', 'No physiologist doubts that a stomach by being adapted to\\ndigest vegetable matter alone, or flesh alone, draws most nutriment from\\nthese substances.', 'So in the general economy of any land, the more widely\\nand perfectly the animals and plants are diversified for different\\nhabits of life, so will a greater number of individuals be capable of\\nthere supporting themselves.', 'A set of animals, with their organisation\\nbut little diversified, could hardly compete with a set more perfectly\\ndiversified in structure.', 'It may be doubted, for instance, whether\\nthe Australian marsupials, which are divided into groups differing but\\nlittle from each other, and feebly representing, as Mr. Waterhouse and\\nothers have remarked, our carnivorous, ruminant, and rodent mammals,\\ncould successfully compete with these well-pronounced orders.', 'In the\\nAustralian mammals, we see the process of diversification in an early\\nand incomplete stage of development.', 'After the foregoing discussion,\\nwhich ought to have been much amplified, we may, I think, assume that\\nthe modified descendants of any one species will succeed by so much\\nthe better as they become more diversified in structure, and are thus\\nenabled to encroach on places occupied by other beings.', 'Now let us see\\nhow this principle of great benefit being derived from divergence of\\ncharacter, combined with the principles of natural selection and of\\nextinction, will tend to act.', 'The accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding this rather\\nperplexing subject.', 'Let A to L represent the species of a genus large\\nin its own country;

for this\\nwill generally lead to the most different or divergent variations\\n(represented by the outer dotted lines) being preserved and accumulated\\nby natural selection.', 'When a dotted line reaches one of the horizontal\\nlines, and is there marked by a small numbered letter, a sufficient\\namount of variation is supposed to have been accumulated to have formed\\na fairly well-marked variety, such as would be thought worthy of record\\nin a systematic work.', 'The intervals between the horizontal lines in the diagram, may represent\\neach a thousand generations;

but, to the best of my judgment, it is explained through\\ninheritance and the complex action of natural selection, entailing\\nextinction and divergence of character, as we have seen illustrated in\\nthe diagram.', 'The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been\\nrepresented by a great tree.', 'I believe this simile largely speaks the\\ntruth.', 'The green and budding twigs may represent existing species; and\\nthose produced during each former year may represent the long succession\\nof extinct species.', 'At each period of growth all the growing twigs\\nhave tried to branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the\\nsurrounding twigs and branches, in the same manner as species and groups\\nof species have tried to overmaster other species in the great battle\\nfor life.', 'The limbs divided into great branches, and these into lesser\\nand lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree was small,\\nbudding twigs; and this connexion of the former and present buds by\\nramifying branches may well represent the classification of all extinct\\nand living species in groups subordinate to groups.', 'Of the many twigs\\nwhich flourished when the tree was a mere bush, only two or three, now\\ngrown into great branches, yet survive and bear all the other branches;\\nso with the species which lived during long-past geological periods,\\nvery few now have living and modified descendants.', 'From the first growth\\nof the tree, many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off;

but many animals have structures which can\\nbe explained by the effects of disuse.', 'As Professor Owen has remarked,\\nthere is no greater anomaly in nature than a bird that cannot fly; yet\\nthere are several in this state.', 'The logger-headed duck of South America\\ncan only flap along the surface of the water, and has its wings in\\nnearly the same condition as the domestic Aylesbury duck.', 'As the larger\\nground-feeding birds seldom take flight except to escape danger, I\\nbelieve that the nearly wingless condition of several birds, which now\\ninhabit or have lately inhabited several oceanic islands, tenanted by\\nno beast of prey, has been caused by disuse.', 'The ostrich indeed inhabits\\ncontinents and is exposed to danger from which it cannot escape by\\nflight, but by kicking it can defend itself from enemies, as well as any\\nof the smaller quadrupeds.', 'We may imagine that the early progenitor\\nof the ostrich had habits like those of a bustard, and that as natural\\nselection increased in successive generations the size and weight of\\nits body, its legs were used more, and its wings less, until they became\\nincapable of flight.', 'Kirby has remarked (and I have observed the same fact) that the anterior\\ntarsi, or feet, of many male dung-feeding beetles are very often broken\\noff; he examined seventeen specimens in his own collection, and not one\\nhad even a relic left.', 'In the Onites apelles the tarsi are so habitually\\nlost, that the insect has been described as not having them.', 'In some\\nother genera they are present, but in a rudimentary condition.', 'In the\\nAteuchus or sacred beetle of the Egyptians, they are totally deficient.', 'There is not sufficient evidence to induce us to believe that\\nmutilations are ever inherited; and I should prefer explaining the\\nentire absence of the anterior tarsi in Ateuchus, and their rudimentary\\ncondition in some other genera, by the long-continued effects of disuse\\nin their progenitors; for as the tarsi are almost always lost in many\\ndung-feeding beetles, they must be lost early in life, and therefore\\ncannot be much used by these insects.', 'In some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications of\\nstructure which are wholly, or mainly, due to natural selection.', 'Mr.\\nWollaston has discovered the remarkable fact that 200 beetles, out of\\nthe 550 species inhabiting Madeira, are so far deficient in wings that\\nthey cannot fly; and that of the twenty-nine endemic genera, no less\\nthan twenty-three genera have all their species in this condition!', 'Several facts, namely, that beetles in many parts of the world are very\\nfrequently blown to sea and perish; that the beetles in Madeira, as\\nobserved by Mr. Wollaston, lie much concealed, until the wind lulls and\\nthe sun shines; that the proportion of wingless beetles is larger on\\nthe exposed Dezertas than in Madeira itself; and especially the\\nextraordinary fact, so strongly insisted on by Mr. Wollaston, of the\\nalmost entire absence of certain large groups of beetles, elsewhere\\nexcessively numerous, and which groups have habits of life almost\\nnecessitating frequent flight;--these several considerations have made\\nme believe that the wingless condition of so many Madeira beetles is\\nmainly due to the action of natural selection, but combined probably\\nwith disuse.', 'For during thousands of successive generations each\\nindividual beetle which flew least, either from its wings having been\\never so little less perfectly developed or from indolent habit, will\\nhave had the best chance of surviving from not being blown out to sea;\\nand, on the other hand, those beetles which most readily took to flight\\nwill oftenest have been blown to sea and thus have been destroyed.', 'The insects in Madeira which are not ground-feeders, and which, as the\\nflower-feeding coleoptera and lepidoptera, must habitually use their\\nwings to gain their subsistence, have, as Mr. Wollaston suspects, their\\nwings not at all reduced, but even enlarged.', 'This is quite compatible\\nwith the action of natural selection.', 'For when a new insect first\\narrived on the island, the tendency of natural selection to enlarge\\nor to reduce the wings, would depend on whether a greater number of\\nindividuals were saved by successfully battling with the winds, or\\nby giving up the attempt and rarely or never flying.', 'As with mariners\\nshipwrecked near a coast, it would have been better for the good\\nswimmers if they had been able to swim still further, whereas it would\\nhave been better for the bad swimmers if they had not been able to swim\\nat all and had stuck to the wreck.', 'The eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary in size,\\nand in some cases are quite covered up by skin and fur.', 'This state of\\nthe eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse, but aided\\nperhaps by natural selection.', 'In South America, a burrowing rodent, the\\ntuco-tuco, or Ctenomys, is even more subterranean in its habits than the\\nmole; and I was assured by a Spaniard, who had often caught them, that\\nthey were frequently blind; one which I kept alive was certainly in\\nthis condition, the cause, as appeared on dissection, having been\\ninflammation of the nictitating membrane.', 'As frequent inflammation of\\nthe eyes must be injurious to any animal, and as eyes are certainly not\\nindispensable to animals with subterranean habits, a reduction in their\\nsize with the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them,\\nmight in such case be an advantage; and if so, natural selection would\\nconstantly aid the effects of disuse.', 'It is well known that several animals, belonging to the most different\\nclasses, which inhabit the caves of Styria and of Kentucky, are blind.', 'In some of the crabs the foot-stalk for the eye remains, though the eye\\nis gone; the stand for the telescope is there, though the telescope\\nwith its glasses has been lost.', 'As it is difficult to imagine that\\neyes, though useless, could be in any way injurious to animals living in\\ndarkness, I attribute their loss wholly to disuse.', 'In one of the\\nblind animals, namely, the cave-rat, the eyes are of immense size; and\\nProfessor Silliman thought that it regained, after living some days in\\nthe light, some slight power of vision.', 'In the same manner as in Madeira\\nthe wings of some of the insects have been enlarged, and the wings of\\nothers have been reduced by natural selection aided by use and disuse,\\nso in the case of the cave-rat natural selection seems to have struggled\\nwith the loss of light and to have increased the size of the eyes;\\nwhereas with all the other inhabitants of the caves, disuse by itself\\nseems to have done its work.', 'It is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than deep\\nlimestone caverns under a nearly similar climate; so that on the\\ncommon view of the blind animals having been separately created for the\\nAmerican and European caverns, close similarity in their organisation\\nand affinities might have been expected; but, as Schiodte and others\\nhave remarked, this is not the case, and the cave-insects of the two\\ncontinents are not more closely allied than might have been anticipated\\nfrom the general resemblance of the other inhabitants of North America\\nand Europe.', 'On my view we must suppose that American animals, having\\nordinary powers of vision, slowly migrated by successive generations\\nfrom the outer world into the deeper and deeper recesses of the Kentucky\\ncaves, as did European animals into the caves of Europe.', 'We have some\\nevidence of this gradation of habit; for, as Schiodte remarks, \"animals\\nnot far remote from ordinary forms, prepare the transition from light to\\ndarkness.', 'Next follow those that are constructed for twilight; and, last\\nof all, those destined for total darkness.\"', 'By the time that an animal\\nhad reached, after numberless generations, the deepest recesses, disuse\\nwill on this view have more or less perfectly obliterated its eyes, and\\nnatural selection will often have effected other changes, such as an\\nincrease in the length of the antennae or palpi, as a compensation for\\nblindness.', 'Notwithstanding such modifications, we might expect still to\\nsee in the cave-animals of America, affinities to the other inhabitants\\nof that continent, and in those of Europe, to the inhabitants of the\\nEuropean continent.', 'And this is the case with some of the American\\ncave-animals, as I hear from Professor Dana; and some of the European\\ncave-insects are very closely allied to those of the surrounding\\ncountry.', 'It would be most difficult to give any rational explanation of\\nthe affinities of the blind cave-animals to the other inhabitants of the\\ntwo continents on the ordinary view of their independent creation.', 'That\\nseveral of the inhabitants of the caves of the Old and New Worlds should\\nbe closely related, we might expect from the well-known relationship of\\nmost of their other productions.', 'Far from feeling any surprise that some\\nof the cave-animals should be very anomalous, as Agassiz has remarked\\nin regard to the blind fish, the Amblyopsis, and as is the case with\\nthe blind Proteus with reference to the reptiles of Europe, I am only\\nsurprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved,\\nowing to the less severe competition to which the inhabitants of these\\ndark abodes will probably have been exposed.', 'ACCLIMATISATION.', 'Habit is hereditary with plants, as in the period of flowering, in the\\namount of rain requisite for seeds to germinate, in the time of sleep,\\netc., and this leads me to say a few words on acclimatisation.', 'As it is\\nextremely common for species of the same genus to inhabit very hot and\\nvery cold countries, and as I believe that all the species of the same\\ngenus have descended from a single parent, if this view be correct,\\nacclimatisation must be readily effected during long-continued descent.', 'It is notorious that each species is adapted to the climate of its own\\nhome: species from an arctic or even from a temperate region cannot\\nendure a tropical climate, or conversely.', 'So again, many succulent\\nplants cannot endure a damp climate.', 'But the degree of adaptation of\\nspecies to the climates under which they live is often overrated.', 'We\\nmay infer this from our frequent inability to predict whether or not an\\nimported plant will endure our climate, and from the number of plants\\nand animals brought from warmer countries which here enjoy good health.', 'We have reason to believe that species in a state of nature are limited\\nin their ranges by the competition of other organic beings quite as much\\nas, or more than, by adaptation to particular climates.', 'But whether or\\nnot the adaptation be generally very close, we have evidence, in\\nthe case of some few plants, of their becoming, to a certain\\nextent, naturally habituated to different temperatures, or becoming\\nacclimatised: thus the pines and rhododendrons, raised from seed\\ncollected by Dr. Hooker from trees growing at different heights on the\\nHimalaya, were found in this country to possess different constitutional\\npowers of resisting cold.', 'Mr. Thwaites informs me that he has observed\\nsimilar facts in Ceylon, and analogous observations have been made by\\nMr. H. C. Watson on European species of plants brought from the Azores\\nto England.', 'In regard to animals, several authentic cases could be given\\nof species within historical times having largely extended their\\nrange from warmer to cooler latitudes, and conversely; but we do not\\npositively know that these animals were strictly adapted to their native\\nclimate, but in all ordinary cases we assume such to be the case; nor\\ndo we know that they have subsequently become acclimatised to their new\\nhomes.', 'As I believe that our domestic animals were originally chosen by\\nuncivilised man because they were useful and bred readily under\\nconfinement, and not because they were subsequently found capable\\nof far-extended transportation, I think the common and extraordinary\\ncapacity in our domestic animals of not only withstanding the most\\ndifferent climates but of being perfectly fertile (a far severer test)\\nunder them, may be used as an argument that a large proportion of other\\nanimals, now in a state of nature, could easily be brought to bear\\nwidely different climates.', 'We must not, however, push the foregoing\\nargument too far, on account of the probable origin of some of our\\ndomestic animals from several wild stocks: the blood, for instance, of\\na tropical and arctic wolf or wild dog may perhaps be mingled in our\\ndomestic breeds.', 'The rat and mouse cannot be considered as domestic\\nanimals, but they have been transported by man to many parts of the\\nworld, and now have a far wider range than any other rodent, living free\\nunder the cold climate of Faroe in the north and of the Falklands in the\\nsouth, and on many islands in the torrid zones.', 'Hence I am inclined to\\nlook at adaptation to any special climate as a quality readily grafted\\non an innate wide flexibility of constitution, which is common to most\\nanimals.', 'On this view, the capacity of enduring the most different\\nclimates by man himself and by his domestic animals, and such facts\\nas that former species of the elephant and rhinoceros were capable\\nof enduring a glacial climate, whereas the living species are now all\\ntropical or sub-tropical in their habits, ought not to be looked at\\nas anomalies, but merely as examples of a very common flexibility of\\nconstitution, brought, under peculiar circumstances, into play.', 'How much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate is\\ndue to mere habit, and how much to the natural selection of varieties\\nhaving different innate constitutions, and how much to both means\\ncombined, is a very obscure question.', 'That habit or custom has some\\ninfluence I must believe, both from analogy, and from the incessant\\nadvice given in agricultural works, even in the ancient Encyclopaedias\\nof China, to be very cautious in transposing animals from one district\\nto another; for it is not likely that man should have succeeded in\\nselecting so many breeds and sub-breeds with constitutions specially\\nfitted for their own districts: the result must, I think, be due to\\nhabit.', 'On the other hand, I can see no reason to doubt that natural\\nselection will continually tend to preserve those individuals which\\nare born with constitutions best adapted to their native countries.', 'In\\ntreatises on many kinds of cultivated plants, certain varieties are\\nsaid to withstand certain climates better than others: this is very\\nstrikingly shown in works on fruit trees published in the United States,\\nin which certain varieties are habitually recommended for the northern,\\nand others for the southern States; and as most of these varieties are\\nof recent origin, they cannot owe their constitutional differences to\\nhabit.', 'The case of the Jerusalem artichoke, which is never propagated\\nby seed, and of which consequently new varieties have not been produced,\\nhas even been advanced--for it is now as tender as ever it was--as\\nproving that acclimatisation cannot be effected!', 'The case, also, of the\\nkidney-bean has been often cited for a similar purpose, and with\\nmuch greater weight; but until some one will sow, during a score of\\ngenerations, his kidney-beans so early that a very large proportion are\\ndestroyed by frost, and then collect seed from the few survivors, with\\ncare to prevent accidental crosses, and then again get seed from these\\nseedlings, with the same precautions, the experiment cannot be said to\\nhave been even tried.', 'Nor let it be supposed that no differences in the\\nconstitution of seedling kidney-beans ever appear, for an account has\\nbeen published how much more hardy some seedlings appeared to be than\\nothers.', 'On the whole, I think we may conclude that habit, use, and disuse, have,\\nin some cases, played a considerable part in the modification of the\\nconstitution, and of the structure of various organs; but that the\\neffects of use and disuse have often been largely combined with, and\\nsometimes overmastered by, the natural selection of innate differences.', 'CORRELATION OF GROWTH.', 'I mean by this expression that the whole organisation is so tied\\ntogether during its growth and development, that when slight variations\\nin any one part occur, and are accumulated through natural selection,\\nother parts become modified.', 'This is a very important subject, most\\nimperfectly understood.', 'The most obvious case is, that modifications\\naccumulated solely for the good of the young or larva, will, it may\\nsafely be concluded, affect the structure of the adult; in the same\\nmanner as any malconformation affecting the early embryo, seriously\\naffects the whole organisation of the adult.', 'The several parts of the\\nbody which are homologous, and which, at an early embryonic period, are\\nalike, seem liable to vary in an allied manner: we see this in the right\\nand left sides of the body varying in the same manner; in the front and\\nhind legs, and even in the jaws and limbs, varying together, for the\\nlower jaw is believed to be homologous with the limbs.', 'These tendencies,\\nI do not doubt, may be mastered more or less completely by natural\\nselection: thus a family of stags once existed with an antler only on\\none side; and if this had been of any great use to the breed it might\\nprobably have been rendered permanent by natural selection.', 'Homologous parts, as has been remarked by some authors, tend to cohere;\\nthis is often seen in monstrous plants; and nothing is more common than\\nthe union of homologous parts in normal structures, as the union of the\\npetals of the corolla into a tube.', 'Hard parts seem to affect the form of\\nadjoining soft parts; it is believed by some authors that the diversity\\nin the shape of the pelvis in birds causes the remarkable diversity in\\nthe shape of their kidneys.', 'Others believe that the shape of the pelvis\\nin the human mother influences by pressure the shape of the head of the\\nchild.', 'In snakes, according to Schlegel, the shape of the body and\\nthe manner of swallowing determine the position of several of the most\\nimportant viscera.', 'The nature of the bond of correlation is very frequently quite obscure.', 'M. Is.', 'Geoffroy St. Hilaire has forcibly remarked, that certain\\nmalconformations very frequently, and that others rarely coexist,\\nwithout our being able to assign any reason.', 'What can be more singular\\nthan the relation between blue eyes and deafness in cats, and the\\ntortoise-shell colour with the female sex; the feathered feet and skin\\nbetween the outer toes in pigeons, and the presence of more or less down\\non the young birds when first hatched, with the future colour of their\\nplumage; or, again, the relation between the hair and teeth in the naked\\nTurkish dog, though here probably homology comes into play?', 'With respect\\nto this latter case of correlation, I think it can hardly be accidental,\\nthat if we pick out the two orders of mammalia which are most\\nabnormal in their dermal coverings, viz.', 'Cetacea (whales) and Edentata\\n(armadilloes, scaly ant-eaters, etc.', '), that these are likewise the most\\nabnormal in their teeth.', 'I know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws of\\ncorrelation in modifying important structures, independently of utility\\nand, therefore, of natural selection, than that of the difference\\nbetween the outer and inner flowers in some Compositous and\\nUmbelliferous plants.', 'Every one knows the difference in the ray and\\ncentral florets of, for instance, the daisy, and this difference is\\noften accompanied with the abortion of parts of the flower.', 'But, in some\\nCompositous plants, the seeds also differ in shape and sculpture; and\\neven the ovary itself, with its accessory parts, differs, as has been\\ndescribed by Cassini.', 'These differences have been attributed by some\\nauthors to pressure, and the shape of the seeds in the ray-florets in\\nsome Compositae countenances this idea; but, in the case of the corolla\\nof the Umbelliferae, it is by no means, as Dr. Hooker informs me, in\\nspecies with the densest heads that the inner and outer flowers most\\nfrequently differ.', 'It might have been thought that the development of\\nthe ray-petals by drawing nourishment from certain other parts of the\\nflower had caused their abortion; but in some Compositae there is a\\ndifference in the seeds of the outer and inner florets without any\\ndifference in the corolla.', 'Possibly, these several differences may be\\nconnected with some difference in the flow of nutriment towards the\\ncentral and external flowers: we know, at least, that in irregular\\nflowers, those nearest to the axis are oftenest subject to peloria, and\\nbecome regular.', 'I may add, as an instance of this, and of a striking\\ncase of correlation, that I have recently observed in some garden\\npelargoniums, that the central flower of the truss often loses the\\npatches of darker colour in the two upper petals; and that when this\\noccurs, the adherent nectary is quite aborted; when the colour is\\nabsent from only one of the two upper petals, the nectary is only much\\nshortened.', \"With respect to the difference in the corolla of the central and\\nexterior flowers of a head or umbel, I do not feel at all sure that C.\\nC. Sprengel's idea that the ray-florets serve to attract insects, whose\\nagency is highly advantageous in the fertilisation of plants of these\\ntwo orders, is so far-fetched, as it may at first appear: and if it be\\nadvantageous, natural selection may have come into play.\", 'But in regard\\nto the differences both in the internal and external structure of the\\nseeds, which are not always correlated with any differences in the\\nflowers, it seems impossible that they can be in any way advantageous\\nto the plant: yet in the Umbelliferae these differences are of such\\napparent importance--the seeds being in some cases, according to Tausch,\\northospermous in the exterior flowers and coelospermous in the central\\nflowers,--that the elder De Candolle founded his main divisions of\\nthe order on analogous differences.', 'Hence we see that modifications of\\nstructure, viewed by systematists as of high value, may be wholly due to\\nunknown laws of correlated growth, and without being, as far as we can\\nsee, of the slightest service to the species.', 'We may often falsely attribute to correlation of growth, structures\\nwhich are common to whole groups of species, and which in truth are\\nsimply due to inheritance; for an ancient progenitor may have acquired\\nthrough natural selection some one modification in structure, and, after\\nthousands of generations, some other and independent modification; and\\nthese two modifications, having been transmitted to a whole group\\nof descendants with diverse habits, would naturally be thought to be\\ncorrelated in some necessary manner.', 'So, again, I do not doubt that some\\napparent correlations, occurring throughout whole orders, are entirely\\ndue to the manner alone in which natural selection can act.', 'For\\ninstance, Alph.', 'De Candolle has remarked that winged seeds are never\\nfound in fruits which do not open: I should explain the rule by the fact\\nthat seeds could not gradually become winged through natural selection,\\nexcept in fruits which opened; so that the individual plants producing\\nseeds which were a little better fitted to be wafted further, might get\\nan advantage over those producing seed less fitted for dispersal; and\\nthis process could not possibly go on in fruit which did not open.', 'The elder Geoffroy and Goethe propounded, at about the same period,\\ntheir law of compensation or balancement of growth; or, as Goethe\\nexpressed it, \"in order to spend on one side, nature is forced to\\neconomise on the other side.\"', 'I think this holds true to a certain\\nextent with our domestic productions: if nourishment flows to one part\\nor organ in excess, it rarely flows, at least in excess, to another\\npart; thus it is difficult to get a cow to give much milk and to fatten\\nreadily.', 'The same varieties of the cabbage do not yield abundant and\\nnutritious foliage and a copious supply of oil-bearing seeds.', 'When the\\nseeds in our fruits become atrophied, the fruit itself gains largely in\\nsize and quality.', 'In our poultry, a large tuft of feathers on the head\\nis generally accompanied by a diminished comb, and a large beard by\\ndiminished wattles.', 'With species in a state of nature it can hardly\\nbe maintained that the law is of universal application; but many good\\nobservers, more especially botanists, believe in its truth.', 'I will\\nnot, however, here give any instances, for I see hardly any way of\\ndistinguishing between the effects, on the one hand, of a part being\\nlargely developed through natural selection and another and adjoining\\npart being reduced by this same process or by disuse, and, on the other\\nhand, the actual withdrawal of nutriment from one part owing to the\\nexcess of growth in another and adjoining part.', 'I suspect, also, that some of the cases of compensation which have been\\nadvanced, and likewise some other facts, may be merged under a more\\ngeneral principle, namely, that natural selection is continually\\ntrying to economise in every part of the organisation.', 'If under changed\\nconditions of life a structure before useful becomes less useful, any\\ndiminution, however slight, in its development, will be seized on by\\nnatural selection, for it will profit the individual not to have its\\nnutriment wasted in building up an useless structure.', 'I can thus\\nonly understand a fact with which I was much struck when examining\\ncirripedes, and of which many other instances could be given: namely,\\nthat when a cirripede is parasitic within another and is thus protected,\\nit loses more or less completely its own shell or carapace.', 'This is the\\ncase with the male Ibla, and in a truly extraordinary manner with the\\nProteolepas: for the carapace in all other cirripedes consists of\\nthe three highly-important anterior segments of the head enormously\\ndeveloped, and furnished with great nerves and muscles; but in the\\nparasitic and protected Proteolepas, the whole anterior part of the\\nhead is reduced to the merest rudiment attached to the bases of the\\nprehensile antennae.', 'Now the saving of a large and complex structure,\\nwhen rendered superfluous by the parasitic habits of the Proteolepas,\\nthough effected by slow steps, would be a decided advantage to each\\nsuccessive individual of the species; for in the struggle for life to\\nwhich every animal is exposed, each individual Proteolepas would have\\na better chance of supporting itself, by less nutriment being wasted in\\ndeveloping a structure now become useless.', 'Thus, as I believe, natural selection will always succeed in the long\\nrun in reducing and saving every part of the organisation, as soon as it\\nis rendered superfluous, without by any means causing some other part\\nto be largely developed in a corresponding degree.', 'And, conversely, that\\nnatural selection may perfectly well succeed in largely developing any\\norgan, without requiring as a necessary compensation the reduction of\\nsome adjoining part.', 'It seems to be a rule, as remarked by Is.', 'Geoffroy St. Hilaire, both in\\nvarieties and in species, that when any part or organ is repeated many\\ntimes in the structure of the same individual (as the vertebrae in\\nsnakes, and the stamens in polyandrous flowers) the number is variable;\\nwhereas the number of the same part or organ, when it occurs in lesser\\nnumbers, is constant.', 'The same author and some botanists have further\\nremarked that multiple parts are also very liable to variation in\\nstructure.', 'Inasmuch as this \"vegetative repetition,\" to use Professor\\nOwen\\'s expression, seems to be a sign of low organisation; the foregoing\\nremark seems connected with the very general opinion of naturalists,\\nthat beings low in the scale of nature are more variable than those\\nwhich are higher.', 'I presume that lowness in this case means that the\\nseveral parts of the organisation have been but little specialised\\nfor particular functions; and as long as the same part has to perform\\ndiversified work, we can perhaps see why it should remain variable, that\\nis, why natural selection should have preserved or rejected each little\\ndeviation of form less carefully than when the part has to serve for one\\nspecial purpose alone.', 'In the same way that a knife which has to cut\\nall sorts of things may be of almost any shape; whilst a tool for\\nsome particular object had better be of some particular shape.', 'Natural\\nselection, it should never be forgotten, can act on each part of each\\nbeing, solely through and for its advantage.', 'Rudimentary parts, it has been stated by some authors, and I believe\\nwith truth, are apt to be highly variable.', 'We shall have to recur to the\\ngeneral subject of rudimentary and aborted organs; and I will here only\\nadd that their variability seems to be owing to their uselessness, and\\ntherefore to natural selection having no power to check deviations in\\ntheir structure.', 'Thus rudimentary parts are left to the free play of the\\nvarious laws of growth, to the effects of long-continued disuse, and to\\nthe tendency to reversion.', 'A PART DEVELOPED IN ANY SPECIES IN AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE OR MANNER,\\nIN COMPARISON WITH THE SAME PART IN ALLIED SPECIES, TENDS TO BE HIGHLY\\nVARIABLE.', 'Several years ago I was much struck with a remark, nearly to the above\\neffect, published by Mr. Waterhouse.', 'I infer also from an observation\\nmade by Professor Owen, with respect to the length of the arms of the\\nourang-outang, that he has come to a nearly similar conclusion.', 'It is\\nhopeless to attempt to convince any one of the truth of this proposition\\nwithout giving the long array of facts which I have collected, and which\\ncannot possibly be here introduced.', 'I can only state my conviction that\\nit is a rule of high generality.', 'I am aware of several causes of\\nerror, but I hope that I have made due allowance for them.', 'It should\\nbe understood that the rule by no means applies to any part, however\\nunusually developed, unless it be unusually developed in comparison with\\nthe same part in closely allied species.', \"Thus, the bat's wing is a most\\nabnormal structure in the class mammalia; but the rule would not here\\napply, because there is a whole group of bats having wings; it would\\napply only if some one species of bat had its wings developed in some\\nremarkable manner in comparison with the other species of the same\\ngenus.\", 'The rule applies very strongly in the case of secondary sexual\\ncharacters, when displayed in any unusual manner.', 'The term, secondary\\nsexual characters, used by Hunter, applies to characters which are\\nattached to one sex, but are not directly connected with the act of\\nreproduction.', 'The rule applies to males and females; but as females more\\nrarely offer remarkable secondary sexual characters, it applies more\\nrarely to them.', 'The rule being so plainly applicable in the case of\\nsecondary sexual characters, may be due to the great variability of\\nthese characters, whether or not displayed in any unusual manner--of\\nwhich fact I think there can be little doubt.', \"But that our rule is not\\nconfined to secondary sexual characters is clearly shown in the case\\nof hermaphrodite cirripedes; and I may here add, that I particularly\\nattended to Mr. Waterhouse's remark, whilst investigating this Order,\\nand I am fully convinced that the rule almost invariably holds good\\nwith cirripedes.\", 'I shall, in my future work, give a list of the more\\nremarkable cases; I will here only briefly give one, as it illustrates\\nthe rule in its largest application.', 'The opercular valves of sessile\\ncirripedes (rock barnacles) are, in every sense of the word, very\\nimportant structures, and they differ extremely little even in different\\ngenera; but in the several species of one genus, Pyrgoma, these valves\\npresent a marvellous amount of diversification: the homologous valves\\nin the different species being sometimes wholly unlike in shape; and the\\namount of variation in the individuals of several of the species is so\\ngreat, that it is no exaggeration to state that the varieties differ\\nmore from each other in the characters of these important valves than do\\nother species of distinct genera.', 'As birds within the same country vary in a remarkably small degree, I\\nhave particularly attended to them, and the rule seems to me certainly\\nto hold good in this class.', 'I cannot make out that it applies to plants,\\nand this would seriously have shaken my belief in its truth, had not the\\ngreat variability in plants made it particularly difficult to compare\\ntheir relative degrees of variability.', 'When we see any part or organ developed in a remarkable degree or manner\\nin any species, the fair presumption is that it is of high importance to\\nthat species; nevertheless the part in this case is eminently liable to\\nvariation.', 'Why should this be so?', 'On the view that each species has been\\nindependently created, with all its parts as we now see them, I can see\\nno explanation.', 'But on the view that groups of species have descended\\nfrom other species, and have been modified through natural selection, I\\nthink we can obtain some light.', 'In our domestic animals, if any part,\\nor the whole animal, be neglected and no selection be applied, that part\\n(for instance, the comb in the Dorking fowl) or the whole breed will\\ncease to have a nearly uniform character.', 'The breed will then be said\\nto have degenerated.', 'In rudimentary organs, and in those which have\\nbeen but little specialised for any particular purpose, and perhaps in\\npolymorphic groups, we see a nearly parallel natural case; for in such\\ncases natural selection either has not or cannot come into full play,\\nand thus the organisation is left in a fluctuating condition.', 'But what\\nhere more especially concerns us is, that in our domestic animals\\nthose points, which at the present time are undergoing rapid change by\\ncontinued selection, are also eminently liable to variation.', 'Look at the\\nbreeds of the pigeon; see what a prodigious amount of difference there\\nis in the beak of the different tumblers, in the beak and wattle of\\nthe different carriers, in the carriage and tail of our fantails, etc.,\\nthese being the points now mainly attended to by English fanciers.', 'Even\\nin the sub-breeds, as in the short-faced tumbler, it is notoriously\\ndifficult to breed them nearly to perfection, and frequently individuals\\nare born which depart widely from the standard.', 'There may be truly\\nsaid to be a constant struggle going on between, on the one hand, the\\ntendency to reversion to a less modified state, as well as an innate\\ntendency to further variability of all kinds, and, on the other hand,\\nthe power of steady selection to keep the breed true.', 'In the long run\\nselection gains the day, and we do not expect to fail so far as to breed\\na bird as coarse as a common tumbler from a good short-faced strain.', 'But\\nas long as selection is rapidly going on, there may always be expected\\nto be much variability in the structure undergoing modification.', \"It\\nfurther deserves notice that these variable characters, produced by\\nman's selection, sometimes become attached, from causes quite unknown\\nto us, more to one sex than to the other, generally to the male sex, as\\nwith the wattle of carriers and the enlarged crop of pouters.\", 'Now let us turn to nature.', 'When a part has been developed in an\\nextraordinary manner in any one species, compared with the other species\\nof the same genus, we may conclude that this part has undergone an\\nextraordinary amount of modification, since the period when the species\\nbranched off from the common progenitor of the genus.', 'This period will\\nseldom be remote in any extreme degree, as species very rarely endure\\nfor more than one geological period.', 'An extraordinary amount of\\nmodification implies an unusually large and long-continued amount of\\nvariability, which has continually been accumulated by natural\\nselection for the benefit of the species.', 'But as the variability of\\nthe extraordinarily-developed part or organ has been so great and\\nlong-continued within a period not excessively remote, we might, as a\\ngeneral rule, expect still to find more variability in such parts than\\nin other parts of the organisation, which have remained for a much\\nlonger period nearly constant.', 'And this, I am convinced, is the case.', 'That the struggle between natural selection on the one hand, and the\\ntendency to reversion and variability on the other hand, will in the\\ncourse of time cease; and that the most abnormally developed organs may\\nbe made constant, I can see no reason to doubt.', 'Hence when an organ,\\nhowever abnormal it may be, has been transmitted in approximately the\\nsame condition to many modified descendants, as in the case of the wing\\nof the bat, it must have existed, according to my theory, for an\\nimmense period in nearly the same state; and thus it comes to be no more\\nvariable than any other structure.', 'It is only in those cases in which\\nthe modification has been comparatively recent and extraordinarily great\\nthat we ought to find the GENERATIVE VARIABILITY, as it may be called,\\nstill present in a high degree.', 'For in this case the variability\\nwill seldom as yet have been fixed by the continued selection of the\\nindividuals varying in the required manner and degree, and by the\\ncontinued rejection of those tending to revert to a former and less\\nmodified condition.', 'The principle included in these remarks may be extended.', 'It is notorious\\nthat specific characters are more variable than generic.', 'To explain by a\\nsimple example what is meant.', 'If some species in a large genus of plants\\nhad blue flowers and some had red, the colour would be only a specific\\ncharacter, and no one would be surprised at one of the blue species\\nvarying into red, or conversely; but if all the species had blue\\nflowers, the colour would become a generic character, and its variation\\nwould be a more unusual circumstance.', 'I have chosen this example because\\nan explanation is not in this case applicable, which most naturalists\\nwould advance, namely, that specific characters are more variable\\nthan generic, because they are taken from parts of less physiological\\nimportance than those commonly used for classing genera.', 'I believe this\\nexplanation is partly, yet only indirectly, true; I shall, however, have\\nto return to this subject in our chapter on Classification.', 'It would be\\nalmost superfluous to adduce evidence in support of the above statement,\\nthat specific characters are more variable than generic; but I have\\nrepeatedly noticed in works on natural history, that when an author\\nhas remarked with surprise that some IMPORTANT organ or part, which is\\ngenerally very constant throughout large groups of species, has DIFFERED\\nconsiderably in closely-allied species, that it has, also, been VARIABLE\\nin the individuals of some of the species.', 'And this fact shows that a\\ncharacter, which is generally of generic value, when it sinks in value\\nand becomes only of specific value, often becomes variable, though its\\nphysiological importance may remain the same.', 'Something of the same kind\\napplies to monstrosities: at least Is.', 'Geoffroy St. Hilaire seems to\\nentertain no doubt, that the more an organ normally differs in\\nthe different species of the same group, the more subject it is to\\nindividual anomalies.', 'On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created,\\nwhy should that part of the structure, which differs from the same\\npart in other independently-created species of the same genus, be\\nmore variable than those parts which are closely alike in the several\\nspecies?', 'I do not see that any explanation can be given.', 'But on the\\nview of species being only strongly marked and fixed varieties, we might\\nsurely expect to find them still often continuing to vary in those parts\\nof their structure which have varied within a moderately recent period,\\nand which have thus come to differ.', 'Or to state the case in another\\nmanner:--the points in which all the species of a genus resemble each\\nother, and in which they differ from the species of some other genus,\\nare called generic characters; and these characters in common I\\nattribute to inheritance from a common progenitor, for it can rarely\\nhave happened that natural selection will have modified several species,\\nfitted to more or less widely-different habits, in exactly the same\\nmanner: and as these so-called generic characters have been inherited\\nfrom a remote period, since that period when the species first branched\\noff from their common progenitor, and subsequently have not varied or\\ncome to differ in any degree, or only in a slight degree, it is not\\nprobable that they should vary at the present day.', 'On the other hand,\\nthe points in which species differ from other species of the same genus,\\nare called specific characters; and as these specific characters have\\nvaried and come to differ within the period of the branching off of the\\nspecies from a common progenitor, it is probable that they should still\\noften be in some degree variable,--at least more variable than those\\nparts of the organisation which have for a very long period remained\\nconstant.', 'In connexion with the present subject, I will make only two other\\nremarks.', 'I think it will be admitted, without my entering on details,\\nthat secondary sexual characters are very variable; I think it also will\\nbe admitted that species of the same group differ from each other more\\nwidely in their secondary sexual characters, than in other parts of\\ntheir organisation; compare, for instance, the amount of difference\\nbetween the males of gallinaceous birds, in which secondary sexual\\ncharacters are strongly displayed, with the amount of difference between\\ntheir females; and the truth of this proposition will be granted.', 'The\\ncause of the original variability of secondary sexual characters is\\nnot manifest; but we can see why these characters should not have been\\nrendered as constant and uniform as other parts of the organisation; for\\nsecondary sexual characters have been accumulated by sexual selection,\\nwhich is less rigid in its action than ordinary selection, as it does\\nnot entail death, but only gives fewer offspring to the less favoured\\nmales.', 'Whatever the cause may be of the variability of secondary sexual\\ncharacters, as they are highly variable, sexual selection will have had\\na wide scope for action, and may thus readily have succeeded in giving\\nto the species of the same group a greater amount of difference in their\\nsexual characters, than in other parts of their structure.', 'It is a remarkable fact, that the secondary sexual differences between\\nthe two sexes of the same species are generally displayed in the very\\nsame parts of the organisation in which the different species of\\nthe same genus differ from each other.', 'Of this fact I will give in\\nillustration two instances, the first which happen to stand on my list;\\nand as the differences in these cases are of a very unusual nature,\\nthe relation can hardly be accidental.', 'The same number of joints in the\\ntarsi is a character generally common to very large groups of beetles,\\nbut in the Engidae, as Westwood has remarked, the number varies greatly;\\nand the number likewise differs in the two sexes of the same species:\\nagain in fossorial hymenoptera, the manner of neuration of the wings is\\na character of the highest importance, because common to large groups;\\nbut in certain genera the neuration differs in the different species,\\nand likewise in the two sexes of the same species.', 'This relation has a\\nclear meaning on my view of the subject: I look at all the species\\nof the same genus as having as certainly descended from the same\\nprogenitor, as have the two sexes of any one of the species.', 'Consequently, whatever part of the structure of the common progenitor,\\nor of its early descendants, became variable; variations of this part\\nwould it is highly probable, be taken advantage of by natural and sexual\\nselection, in order to fit the several species to their several places\\nin the economy of nature, and likewise to fit the two sexes of the same\\nspecies to each other, or to fit the males and females to different\\nhabits of life, or the males to struggle with other males for the\\npossession of the females.', 'Finally, then, I conclude that the greater variability of specific\\ncharacters, or those which distinguish species from species, than of\\ngeneric characters, or those which the species possess in common;--that\\nthe frequent extreme variability of any part which is developed in a\\nspecies in an extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part\\nin its congeners; and the not great degree of variability in a part,\\nhowever extraordinarily it may be developed, if it be common to a\\nwhole group of species;--that the great variability of secondary sexual\\ncharacters, and the great amount of difference in these same characters\\nbetween closely allied species;--that secondary sexual and ordinary\\nspecific differences are generally displayed in the same parts of the\\norganisation,--are all principles closely connected together.', 'All being\\nmainly due to the species of the same group having descended from a\\ncommon progenitor, from whom they have inherited much in common,--to\\nparts which have recently and largely varied being more likely still\\nto go on varying than parts which have long been inherited and have not\\nvaried,--to natural selection having more or less completely, according\\nto the lapse of time, overmastered the tendency to reversion and to\\nfurther variability,--to sexual selection being less rigid than ordinary\\nselection,--and to variations in the same parts having been accumulated\\nby natural and sexual selection, and thus adapted for secondary sexual,\\nand for ordinary specific purposes.', 'DISTINCT SPECIES PRESENT ANALOGOUS VARIATIONS; AND A VARIETY OF ONE\\nSPECIES OFTEN ASSUMES SOME OF THE CHARACTERS OF AN ALLIED SPECIES, OR\\nREVERTS TO SOME OF THE CHARACTERS OF AN EARLY PROGENITOR.', 'These propositions will be most readily understood by looking to our\\ndomestic races.', 'The most distinct breeds of pigeons, in countries most\\nwidely apart, present sub-varieties with reversed feathers on the head\\nand feathers on the feet,--characters not possessed by the aboriginal\\nrock-pigeon; these then are analogous variations in two or more distinct\\nraces.', 'The frequent presence of fourteen or even sixteen tail-feathers\\nin the pouter, may be considered as a variation representing the normal\\nstructure of another race, the fantail.', 'I presume that no one will doubt\\nthat all such analogous variations are due to the several races of the\\npigeon having inherited from a common parent the same constitution and\\ntendency to variation, when acted on by similar unknown influences.', 'In the vegetable kingdom we have a case of analogous variation, in the\\nenlarged stems, or roots as commonly called, of the Swedish turnip and\\nRuta baga, plants which several botanists rank as varieties produced by\\ncultivation from a common parent: if this be not so, the case will then\\nbe one of analogous variation in two so-called distinct species; and to\\nthese a third may be added, namely, the common turnip.', 'According to\\nthe ordinary view of each species having been independently created, we\\nshould have to attribute this similarity in the enlarged stems of these\\nthree plants, not to the vera causa of community of descent, and a\\nconsequent tendency to vary in a like manner, but to three separate yet\\nclosely related acts of creation.', 'With pigeons, however, we have another case, namely, the occasional\\nappearance in all the breeds, of slaty-blue birds with two black bars\\non the wings, a white rump, a bar at the end of the tail, with the outer\\nfeathers externally edged near their bases with white.', 'As all these\\nmarks are characteristic of the parent rock-pigeon, I presume that no\\none will doubt that this is a case of reversion, and not of a new yet\\nanalogous variation appearing in the several breeds.', 'We may I think\\nconfidently come to this conclusion, because, as we have seen, these\\ncoloured marks are eminently liable to appear in the crossed offspring\\nof two distinct and differently coloured breeds; and in this case there\\nis nothing in the external conditions of life to cause the reappearance\\nof the slaty-blue, with the several marks, beyond the influence of the\\nmere act of crossing on the laws of inheritance.', 'No doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should reappear\\nafter having been lost for many, perhaps for hundreds of generations.', 'But when a breed has been crossed only once by some other breed, the\\noffspring occasionally show a tendency to revert in character to the\\nforeign breed for many generations--some say, for a dozen or even a\\nscore of generations.', 'After twelve generations, the proportion of blood,\\nto use a common expression, of any one ancestor, is only 1 in 2048; and\\nyet, as we see, it is generally believed that a tendency to reversion\\nis retained by this very small proportion of foreign blood.', 'In a breed\\nwhich has not been crossed, but in which BOTH parents have lost some\\ncharacter which their progenitor possessed, the tendency, whether strong\\nor weak, to reproduce the lost character might be, as was formerly\\nremarked, for all that we can see to the contrary, transmitted for\\nalmost any number of generations.', 'When a character which has been lost\\nin a breed, reappears after a great number of generations, the most\\nprobable hypothesis is, not that the offspring suddenly takes after an\\nancestor some hundred generations distant, but that in each successive\\ngeneration there has been a tendency to reproduce the character in\\nquestion, which at last, under unknown favourable conditions, gains an\\nascendancy.', 'For instance, it is probable that in each generation of the\\nbarb-pigeon, which produces most rarely a blue and black-barred bird,\\nthere has been a tendency in each generation in the plumage to assume\\nthis colour.', 'This view is hypothetical, but could be supported by some\\nfacts; and I can see no more abstract improbability in a tendency\\nto produce any character being inherited for an endless number of\\ngenerations, than in quite useless or rudimentary organs being, as we\\nall know them to be, thus inherited.', 'Indeed, we may sometimes observe\\na mere tendency to produce a rudiment inherited: for instance, in the\\ncommon snapdragon (Antirrhinum) a rudiment of a fifth stamen so often\\nappears, that this plant must have an inherited tendency to produce it.', 'As all the species of the same genus are supposed, on my theory, to have\\ndescended from a common parent, it might be expected that they would\\noccasionally vary in an analogous manner; so that a variety of one\\nspecies would resemble in some of its characters another species; this\\nother species being on my view only a well-marked and permanent variety.', 'But characters thus gained would probably be of an unimportant nature,\\nfor the presence of all important characters will be governed by natural\\nselection, in accordance with the diverse habits of the species, and\\nwill not be left to the mutual action of the conditions of life and of\\na similar inherited constitution.', 'It might further be expected that the\\nspecies of the same genus would occasionally exhibit reversions to lost\\nancestral characters.', 'As, however, we never know the exact character\\nof the common ancestor of a group, we could not distinguish these two\\ncases: if, for instance, we did not know that the rock-pigeon was not\\nfeather-footed or turn-crowned, we could not have told, whether these\\ncharacters in our domestic breeds were reversions or only analogous\\nvariations; but we might have inferred that the blueness was a case of\\nreversion, from the number of the markings, which are correlated with\\nthe blue tint, and which it does not appear probable would all appear\\ntogether from simple variation.', 'More especially we might have inferred\\nthis, from the blue colour and marks so often appearing when distinct\\nbreeds of diverse colours are crossed.', 'Hence, though under nature\\nit must generally be left doubtful, what cases are reversions to an\\nanciently existing character, and what are new but analogous variations,\\nyet we ought, on my theory, sometimes to find the varying offspring of\\na species assuming characters (either from reversion or from analogous\\nvariation) which already occur in some other members of the same group.', 'And this undoubtedly is the case in nature.', 'A considerable part of the difficulty in recognising a variable species\\nin our systematic works, is due to its varieties mocking, as it were,\\nsome of the other species of the same genus.', 'A considerable catalogue,\\nalso, could be given of forms intermediate between two other forms,\\nwhich themselves must be doubtfully ranked as either varieties or\\nspecies; and this shows, unless all these forms be considered as\\nindependently created species, that the one in varying has assumed some\\nof the characters of the other, so as to produce the intermediate form.', 'But the best evidence is afforded by parts or organs of an important and\\nuniform nature occasionally varying so as to acquire, in some degree,\\nthe character of the same part or organ in an allied species.', 'I have\\ncollected a long list of such cases; but here, as before, I lie under\\na great disadvantage in not being able to give them.', 'I can only repeat\\nthat such cases certainly do occur, and seem to me very remarkable.', 'I will, however, give one curious and complex case, not indeed as\\naffecting any important character, but from occurring in several species\\nof the same genus, partly under domestication and partly under nature.', 'It is a case apparently of reversion.', 'The ass not rarely has very\\ndistinct transverse bars on its legs, like those on the legs of a zebra:\\nit has been asserted that these are plainest in the foal, and from\\ninquiries which I have made, I believe this to be true.', 'It has also\\nbeen asserted that the stripe on each shoulder is sometimes double.', 'The shoulder stripe is certainly very variable in length and outline.', 'A\\nwhite ass, but NOT an albino, has been described without either spinal\\nor shoulder-stripe;

but traces of it, as stated by Mr. Blyth and others,\\noccasionally appear: and I have been informed by Colonel Poole that the\\nfoals of this species are generally striped on the legs, and faintly on\\nthe shoulder.', 'The quagga, though so plainly barred like a zebra over the\\nbody, is without bars on the legs; but Dr. Gray has figured one specimen\\nwith very distinct zebra-like bars on the hocks.', 'With respect to the horse, I have collected cases in England of the\\nspinal stripe in horses of the most distinct breeds, and of ALL colours;\\ntransverse bars on the legs are not rare in duns, mouse-duns, and in one\\ninstance in a chestnut: a faint shoulder-stripe may sometimes be seen\\nin duns, and I have seen a trace in a bay horse.', 'My son made a careful\\nexamination and sketch for me of a dun Belgian cart-horse with a double\\nstripe on each shoulder and with leg-stripes; and a man, whom I can\\nimplicitly trust, has examined for me a small dun Welch pony with THREE\\nshort parallel stripes on each shoulder.', 'In the north-west part of India the Kattywar breed of horses is so\\ngenerally striped, that, as I hear from Colonel Poole, who examined\\nthe breed for the Indian Government, a horse without stripes is not\\nconsidered as purely-bred.', 'The spine is always striped; the legs are\\ngenerally barred; and the shoulder-stripe, which is sometimes double\\nand sometimes treble, is common; the side of the face, moreover, is\\nsometimes striped.', 'The stripes are plainest in the foal; and sometimes\\nquite disappear in old horses.', 'Colonel Poole has seen both gray and\\nbay Kattywar horses striped when first foaled.', 'I have, also, reason to\\nsuspect, from information given me by Mr. W. W. Edwards, that with the\\nEnglish race-horse the spinal stripe is much commoner in the foal than\\nin the full-grown animal.', 'Without here entering on further details, I\\nmay state that I have collected cases of leg and shoulder stripes in\\nhorses of very different breeds, in various countries from Britain to\\nEastern China; and from Norway in the north to the Malay Archipelago in\\nthe south.', 'In all parts of the world these stripes occur far oftenest\\nin duns and mouse-duns; by the term dun a large range of colour is\\nincluded, from one between brown and black to a close approach to\\ncream-colour.', 'I am aware that Colonel Hamilton Smith, who has written on this subject,\\nbelieves that the several breeds of the horse have descended from\\nseveral aboriginal species--one of which, the dun, was striped; and that\\nthe above-described appearances are all due to ancient crosses with the\\ndun stock.', 'But I am not at all satisfied with this theory, and should be\\nloth to apply it to breeds so distinct as the heavy Belgian cart-horse,\\nWelch ponies, cobs, the lanky Kattywar race, etc., inhabiting the most\\ndistant parts of the world.', 'Now let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species of the\\nhorse-genus.', 'Rollin asserts, that the common mule from the ass and horse\\nis particularly apt to have bars on its legs.', 'I once saw a mule with its\\nlegs so much striped that any one at first would have thought that it\\nmust have been the product of a zebra; and Mr. W. C. Martin, in his\\nexcellent treatise on the horse, has given a figure of a similar mule.', 'In four coloured drawings, which I have seen, of hybrids between the ass\\nand zebra, the legs were much more plainly barred than the rest of the\\nbody; and in one of them there was a double shoulder-stripe.', \"In Lord\\nMoreton's famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the\\nhybrid, and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare\\nby a black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the\\nlegs than is even the pure quagga.\", 'Lastly, and this is another most\\nremarkable case, a hybrid has been figured by Dr. Gray (and he informs\\nme that he knows of a second case) from the ass and the hemionus; and\\nthis hybrid, though the ass seldom has stripes on its legs and the\\nhemionus has none and has not even a shoulder-stripe, nevertheless had\\nall four legs barred, and had three short shoulder-stripes, like those\\non the dun Welch pony, and even had some zebra-like stripes on the sides\\nof its face.', 'With respect to this last fact, I was so convinced that not\\neven a stripe of colour appears from what would commonly be called an\\naccident, that I was led solely from the occurrence of the face-stripes\\non this hybrid from the ass and hemionus, to ask Colonel Poole whether\\nsuch face-stripes ever occur in the eminently striped Kattywar breed of\\nhorses, and was, as we have seen, answered in the affirmative.', 'What now are we to say to these several facts?', 'We see several very\\ndistinct species of the horse-genus becoming, by simple variation,\\nstriped on the legs like a zebra, or striped on the shoulders like\\nan ass.', 'In the horse we see this tendency strong whenever a dun tint\\nappears--a tint which approaches to that of the general colouring of\\nthe other species of the genus.', 'The appearance of the stripes is not\\naccompanied by any change of form or by any other new character.', 'We see\\nthis tendency to become striped most strongly displayed in hybrids from\\nbetween several of the most distinct species.', 'Now observe the case\\nof the several breeds of pigeons: they are descended from a pigeon\\n(including two or three sub-species or geographical races) of a bluish\\ncolour, with certain bars and other marks; and when any breed assumes\\nby simple variation a bluish tint, these bars and other marks invariably\\nreappear; but without any other change of form or character.', 'When the\\noldest and truest breeds of various colours are crossed, we see a\\nstrong tendency for the blue tint and bars and marks to reappear in the\\nmongrels.', 'I have stated that the most probable hypothesis to account\\nfor the reappearance of very ancient characters, is--that there is\\na TENDENCY in the young of each successive generation to produce the\\nlong-lost character, and that this tendency, from unknown causes,\\nsometimes prevails.', 'And we have just seen that in several species of the\\nhorse-genus the stripes are either plainer or appear more commonly in\\nthe young than in the old.', 'Call the breeds of pigeons, some of which\\nhave bred true for centuries, species; and how exactly parallel is the\\ncase with that of the species of the horse-genus!', 'For myself, I venture\\nconfidently to look back thousands on thousands of generations, and\\nI see an animal striped like a zebra, but perhaps otherwise very\\ndifferently constructed, the common parent of our domestic horse,\\nwhether or not it be descended from one or more wild stocks, of the ass,\\nthe hemionus, quagga, and zebra.', 'He who believes that each equine species was independently created,\\nwill, I presume, assert that each species has been created with a\\ntendency to vary, both under nature and under domestication, in this\\nparticular manner, so as often to become striped like other species of\\nthe genus; and that each has been created with a strong tendency,\\nwhen crossed with species inhabiting distant quarters of the world, to\\nproduce hybrids resembling in their stripes, not their own parents, but\\nother species of the genus.', 'To admit this view is, as it seems to me, to\\nreject a real for an unreal, or at least for an unknown, cause.', 'It makes\\nthe works of God a mere mockery and deception;

and I will\\nhere only state that I believe the answer mainly lies in the record\\nbeing incomparably less perfect than is generally supposed; the\\nimperfection of the record being chiefly due to organic beings not\\ninhabiting profound depths of the sea, and to their remains being\\nembedded and preserved to a future age only in masses of sediment\\nsufficiently thick and extensive to withstand an enormous amount of\\nfuture degradation;

and as the one becomes rarer and\\nrarer, the other becomes more and more frequent, till the one replaces\\nthe other.', 'But if we compare these species where they intermingle, they\\nare generally as absolutely distinct from each other in every detail of\\nstructure as are specimens taken from the metropolis inhabited by each.', 'By my theory these allied species have descended from a common parent;\\nand during the process of modification, each has become adapted to\\nthe conditions of life of its own region, and has supplanted and\\nexterminated its original parent and all the transitional varieties\\nbetween its past and present states.', 'Hence we ought not to expect at\\nthe present time to meet with numerous transitional varieties in each\\nregion, though they must have existed there, and may be embedded\\nthere in a fossil condition.', 'But in the intermediate region, having\\nintermediate conditions of life, why do we not now find closely-linking\\nintermediate varieties?', 'This difficulty for a long time quite confounded\\nme.', 'But I think it can be in large part explained.', 'In the first place we should be extremely cautious in inferring, because\\nan area is now continuous, that it has been continuous during a long\\nperiod.', 'Geology would lead us to believe that almost every continent has\\nbeen broken up into islands even during the later tertiary periods;\\nand in such islands distinct species might have been separately formed\\nwithout the possibility of intermediate varieties existing in the\\nintermediate zones.', 'By changes in the form of the land and of climate,\\nmarine areas now continuous must often have existed within recent times\\nin a far less continuous and uniform condition than at present.', 'But I\\nwill pass over this way of escaping from the difficulty; for I believe\\nthat many perfectly defined species have been formed on strictly\\ncontinuous areas; though I do not doubt that the formerly broken\\ncondition of areas now continuous has played an important part in the\\nformation of new species, more especially with freely-crossing and\\nwandering animals.', 'In looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide area,\\nwe generally find them tolerably numerous over a large territory, then\\nbecoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the confines, and finally\\ndisappearing.', 'Hence the neutral territory between two representative\\nspecies is generally narrow in comparison with the territory proper to\\neach.', 'We see the same fact in ascending mountains, and sometimes it\\nis quite remarkable how abruptly, as Alph.', 'De Candolle has observed,\\na common alpine species disappears.', 'The same fact has been noticed by\\nForbes in sounding the depths of the sea with the dredge.', 'To those who\\nlook at climate and the physical conditions of life as the all-important\\nelements of distribution, these facts ought to cause surprise, as\\nclimate and height or depth graduate away insensibly.', 'But when we\\nbear in mind that almost every species, even in its metropolis, would\\nincrease immensely in numbers, were it not for other competing species;\\nthat nearly all either prey on or serve as prey for others; in short,\\nthat each organic being is either directly or indirectly related in\\nthe most important manner to other organic beings, we must see that the\\nrange of the inhabitants of any country by no means exclusively depends\\non insensibly changing physical conditions, but in large part on the\\npresence of other species, on which it depends, or by which it is\\ndestroyed, or with which it comes into competition; and as these species\\nare already defined objects (however they may have become so), not\\nblending one into another by insensible gradations, the range of any one\\nspecies, depending as it does on the range of others, will tend to be\\nsharply defined.', 'Moreover, each species on the confines of its range,\\nwhere it exists in lessened numbers, will, during fluctuations in the\\nnumber of its enemies or of its prey, or in the seasons, be extremely\\nliable to utter extermination; and thus its geographical range will come\\nto be still more sharply defined.', 'If I am right in believing that allied or representative species, when\\ninhabiting a continuous area, are generally so distributed that each\\nhas a wide range, with a comparatively narrow neutral territory between\\nthem, in which they become rather suddenly rarer and rarer; then, as\\nvarieties do not essentially differ from species, the same rule will\\nprobably apply to both; and if we in imagination adapt a varying species\\nto a very large area, we shall have to adapt two varieties to two\\nlarge areas, and a third variety to a narrow intermediate zone.', 'The\\nintermediate variety, consequently, will exist in lesser numbers from\\ninhabiting a narrow and lesser area; and practically, as far as I can\\nmake out, this rule holds good with varieties in a state of nature.', 'I\\nhave met with striking instances of the rule in the case of varieties\\nintermediate between well-marked varieties in the genus Balanus.', 'And it\\nwould appear from information given me by Mr. Watson, Dr. Asa Gray, and\\nMr. Wollaston, that generally when varieties intermediate between two\\nother forms occur, they are much rarer numerically than the forms which\\nthey connect.', 'Now, if we may trust these facts and inferences, and\\ntherefore conclude that varieties linking two other varieties together\\nhave generally existed in lesser numbers than the forms which they\\nconnect, then, I think, we can understand why intermediate varieties\\nshould not endure for very long periods;--why as a general rule they\\nshould be exterminated and disappear, sooner than the forms which they\\noriginally linked together.', 'For any form existing in lesser numbers would, as already remarked,\\nrun a greater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large\\nnumbers; and in this particular case the intermediate form would be\\neminently liable to the inroads of closely allied forms existing on both\\nsides of it.', 'But a far more important consideration, as I believe, is\\nthat, during the process of further modification, by which two varieties\\nare supposed on my theory to be converted and perfected into two\\ndistinct species, the two which exist in larger numbers from inhabiting\\nlarger areas, will have a great advantage over the intermediate variety,\\nwhich exists in smaller numbers in a narrow and intermediate zone.', 'For forms existing in larger numbers will always have a better chance,\\nwithin any given period, of presenting further favourable variations for\\nnatural selection to seize on, than will the rarer forms which exist in\\nlesser numbers.', 'Hence, the more common forms, in the race for life, will\\ntend to beat and supplant the less common forms, for these will be\\nmore slowly modified and improved.', 'It is the same principle which, as\\nI believe, accounts for the common species in each country, as shown\\nin the second chapter, presenting on an average a greater number of\\nwell-marked varieties than do the rarer species.', 'I may illustrate what I\\nmean by supposing three varieties of sheep to be kept, one adapted to an\\nextensive mountainous region; a second to a comparatively narrow, hilly\\ntract; and a third to wide plains at the base; and that the inhabitants\\nare all trying with equal steadiness and skill to improve their stocks\\nby selection; the chances in this case will be strongly in favour of the\\ngreat holders on the mountains or on the plains improving their breeds\\nmore quickly than the small holders on the intermediate narrow, hilly\\ntract; and consequently the improved mountain or plain breed will soon\\ntake the place of the less improved hill breed; and thus the two breeds,\\nwhich originally existed in greater numbers, will come into close\\ncontact with each other, without the interposition of the supplanted,\\nintermediate hill-variety.', 'To sum up, I believe that species come to be tolerably well-defined\\nobjects, and do not at any one period present an inextricable chaos of\\nvarying and intermediate links: firstly, because new varieties are\\nvery slowly formed, for variation is a very slow process, and natural\\nselection can do nothing until favourable variations chance to occur,\\nand until a place in the natural polity of the country can be better\\nfilled by some modification of some one or more of its inhabitants.', 'And such new places will depend on slow changes of climate, or on the\\noccasional immigration of new inhabitants, and, probably, in a still\\nmore important degree, on some of the old inhabitants becoming slowly\\nmodified, with the new forms thus produced and the old ones acting and\\nreacting on each other.', 'So that, in any one region and at any one time,\\nwe ought only to see a few species presenting slight modifications of\\nstructure in some degree permanent; and this assuredly we do see.', 'Secondly, areas now continuous must often have existed within the\\nrecent period in isolated portions, in which many forms, more especially\\namongst the classes which unite for each birth and wander much, may have\\nseparately been rendered sufficiently distinct to rank as representative\\nspecies.', 'In this case, intermediate varieties between the several\\nrepresentative species and their common parent, must formerly have\\nexisted in each broken portion of the land, but these links will\\nhave been supplanted and exterminated during the process of natural\\nselection, so that they will no longer exist in a living state.', 'Thirdly, when two or more varieties have been formed in different\\nportions of a strictly continuous area, intermediate varieties will, it\\nis probable, at first have been formed in the intermediate zones, but\\nthey will generally have had a short duration.', 'For these intermediate\\nvarieties will, from reasons already assigned (namely from what we know\\nof the actual distribution of closely allied or representative species,\\nand likewise of acknowledged varieties), exist in the intermediate zones\\nin lesser numbers than the varieties which they tend to connect.', 'From\\nthis cause alone the intermediate varieties will be liable to accidental\\nextermination; and during the process of further modification through\\nnatural selection, they will almost certainly be beaten and supplanted\\nby the forms which they connect; for these from existing in greater\\nnumbers will, in the aggregate, present more variation, and thus be\\nfurther improved through natural selection and gain further advantages.', 'Lastly, looking not to any one time, but to all time, if my theory be\\ntrue, numberless intermediate varieties, linking most closely all the\\nspecies of the same group together, must assuredly have existed; but the\\nvery process of natural selection constantly tends, as has been so often\\nremarked, to exterminate the parent forms and the intermediate links.', 'Consequently evidence of their former existence could be found only\\namongst fossil remains, which are preserved, as we shall in a future\\nchapter attempt to show, in an extremely imperfect and intermittent\\nrecord.', 'ON THE ORIGIN AND TRANSITIONS OF ORGANIC BEINGS WITH PECULIAR HABITS AND\\nSTRUCTURE.', 'It has been asked by the opponents of such views as I hold, how, for\\ninstance, a land carnivorous animal could have been converted into one\\nwith aquatic habits; for how could the animal in its transitional state\\nhave subsisted?', 'It would be easy to show that within the same group\\ncarnivorous animals exist having every intermediate grade between\\ntruly aquatic and strictly terrestrial habits; and as each exists by a\\nstruggle for life, it is clear that each is well adapted in its habits\\nto its place in nature.', 'Look at the Mustela vison of North America,\\nwhich has webbed feet and which resembles an otter in its fur, short\\nlegs, and form of tail; during summer this animal dives for and preys on\\nfish, but during the long winter it leaves the frozen waters, and preys\\nlike other polecats on mice and land animals.', 'If a different case had\\nbeen taken, and it had been asked how an insectivorous quadruped could\\npossibly have been converted into a flying bat, the question would have\\nbeen far more difficult, and I could have given no answer.', 'Yet I think\\nsuch difficulties have very little weight.', 'Here, as on other occasions, I lie under a heavy disadvantage, for out\\nof the many striking cases which I have collected, I can give only one\\nor two instances of transitional habits and structures in closely allied\\nspecies of the same genus; and of diversified habits, either constant\\nor occasional, in the same species.', 'And it seems to me that nothing less\\nthan a long list of such cases is sufficient to lessen the difficulty in\\nany particular case like that of the bat.', 'Look at the family of squirrels; here we have the finest gradation from\\nanimals with their tails only slightly flattened, and from others, as\\nSir J. Richardson has remarked, with the posterior part of their bodies\\nrather wide and with the skin on their flanks rather full, to the\\nso-called flying squirrels; and flying squirrels have their limbs and\\neven the base of the tail united by a broad expanse of skin, which\\nserves as a parachute and allows them to glide through the air to\\nan astonishing distance from tree to tree.', 'We cannot doubt that each\\nstructure is of use to each kind of squirrel in its own country, by\\nenabling it to escape birds or beasts of prey, or to collect food more\\nquickly, or, as there is reason to believe, by lessening the danger\\nfrom occasional falls.', 'But it does not follow from this fact that the\\nstructure of each squirrel is the best that it is possible to conceive\\nunder all natural conditions.', 'Let the climate and vegetation change,\\nlet other competing rodents or new beasts of prey immigrate, or old ones\\nbecome modified, and all analogy would lead us to believe that some at\\nleast of the squirrels would decrease in numbers or become exterminated,\\nunless they also became modified and improved in structure in a\\ncorresponding manner.', 'Therefore, I can see no difficulty, more\\nespecially under changing conditions of life, in the continued\\npreservation of individuals with fuller and fuller flank-membranes,\\neach modification being useful, each being propagated, until by the\\naccumulated effects of this process of natural selection, a perfect\\nso-called flying squirrel was produced.', 'Now look at the Galeopithecus or flying lemur, which formerly was\\nfalsely ranked amongst bats.', 'It has an extremely wide flank-membrane,\\nstretching from the corners of the jaw to the tail, and including the\\nlimbs and the elongated fingers: the flank membrane is, also, furnished\\nwith an extensor muscle.', 'Although no graduated links of structure,\\nfitted for gliding through the air, now connect the Galeopithecus with\\nthe other Lemuridae, yet I can see no difficulty in supposing that such\\nlinks formerly existed, and that each had been formed by the same steps\\nas in the case of the less perfectly gliding squirrels; and that each\\ngrade of structure had been useful to its possessor.', 'Nor can I see\\nany insuperable difficulty in further believing it possible that the\\nmembrane-connected fingers and fore-arm of the Galeopithecus might be\\ngreatly lengthened by natural selection; and this, as far as the organs\\nof flight are concerned, would convert it into a bat.', 'In bats which have\\nthe wing-membrane extended from the top of the shoulder to the\\ntail, including the hind-legs, we perhaps see traces of an apparatus\\noriginally constructed for gliding through the air rather than for\\nflight.', 'If about a dozen genera of birds had become extinct or were unknown, who\\nwould have ventured to have surmised that birds might have existed\\nwhich used their wings solely as flappers, like the logger-headed duck\\n(Micropterus of Eyton); as fins in the water and front legs on the land,\\nlike the penguin; as sails, like the ostrich; and functionally for no\\npurpose, like the Apteryx.', 'Yet the structure of each of these birds is\\ngood for it, under the conditions of life to which it is exposed, for\\neach has to live by a struggle; but it is not necessarily the best\\npossible under all possible conditions.', 'It must not be inferred from\\nthese remarks that any of the grades of wing-structure here alluded to,\\nwhich perhaps may all have resulted from disuse, indicate the natural\\nsteps by which birds have acquired their perfect power of flight; but\\nthey serve, at least, to show what diversified means of transition are\\npossible.', 'Seeing that a few members of such water-breathing classes as the\\nCrustacea and Mollusca are adapted to live on the land, and seeing that\\nwe have flying birds and mammals, flying insects of the most diversified\\ntypes, and formerly had flying reptiles, it is conceivable that\\nflying-fish, which now glide far through the air, slightly rising and\\nturning by the aid of their fluttering fins, might have been modified\\ninto perfectly winged animals.', 'If this had been effected, who would\\nhave ever imagined that in an early transitional state they had been\\ninhabitants of the open ocean, and had used their incipient organs of\\nflight exclusively, as far as we know, to escape being devoured by other\\nfish?', 'When we see any structure highly perfected for any particular habit,\\nas the wings of a bird for flight, we should bear in mind that animals\\ndisplaying early transitional grades of the structure will seldom\\ncontinue to exist to the present day, for they will have been\\nsupplanted by the very process of perfection through natural selection.', 'Furthermore, we may conclude that transitional grades between structures\\nfitted for very different habits of life will rarely have been developed\\nat an early period in great numbers and under many subordinate forms.', 'Thus, to return to our imaginary illustration of the flying-fish, it\\ndoes not seem probable that fishes capable of true flight would have\\nbeen developed under many subordinate forms, for taking prey of many\\nkinds in many ways, on the land and in the water, until their organs of\\nflight had come to a high stage of perfection, so as to have given them\\na decided advantage over other animals in the battle for life.', 'Hence the\\nchance of discovering species with transitional grades of structure in\\na fossil condition will always be less, from their having existed\\nin lesser numbers, than in the case of species with fully developed\\nstructures.', 'I will now give two or three instances of diversified and of changed\\nhabits in the individuals of the same species.', 'When either case occurs,\\nit would be easy for natural selection to fit the animal, by some\\nmodification of its structure, for its changed habits, or exclusively\\nfor one of its several different habits.', 'But it is difficult to tell,\\nand immaterial for us, whether habits generally change first and\\nstructure afterwards; or whether slight modifications of structure lead\\nto changed habits; both probably often change almost simultaneously.', 'Of\\ncases of changed habits it will suffice merely to allude to that of the\\nmany British insects which now feed on exotic plants, or exclusively on\\nartificial substances.', 'Of diversified habits innumerable instances\\ncould be given: I have often watched a tyrant flycatcher (Saurophagus\\nsulphuratus) in South America, hovering over one spot and then\\nproceeding to another, like a kestrel, and at other times standing\\nstationary on the margin of water, and then dashing like a kingfisher at\\na fish.', 'In our own country the larger titmouse (Parus major) may be seen\\nclimbing branches, almost like a creeper; it often, like a shrike, kills\\nsmall birds by blows on the head; and I have many times seen and heard\\nit hammering the seeds of the yew on a branch, and thus breaking them\\nlike a nuthatch.', 'In North America the black bear was seen by Hearne\\nswimming for hours with widely open mouth, thus catching, like a whale,\\ninsects in the water.', 'Even in so extreme a case as this, if the supply\\nof insects were constant, and if better adapted competitors did not\\nalready exist in the country, I can see no difficulty in a race of bears\\nbeing rendered, by natural selection, more and more aquatic in their\\nstructure and habits, with larger and larger mouths, till a creature was\\nproduced as monstrous as a whale.', 'As we sometimes see individuals of a species following habits widely\\ndifferent from those both of their own species and of the other species\\nof the same genus, we might expect, on my theory, that such individuals\\nwould occasionally have given rise to new species, having anomalous\\nhabits, and with their structure either slightly or considerably\\nmodified from that of their proper type.', 'And such instances do occur in\\nnature.', 'Can a more striking instance of adaptation be given than that of\\na woodpecker for climbing trees and for seizing insects in the chinks of\\nthe bark?', 'Yet in North America there are woodpeckers which feed largely\\non fruit, and others with elongated wings which chase insects on the\\nwing; and on the plains of La Plata, where not a tree grows, there is a\\nwoodpecker, which in every essential part of its organisation, even in\\nits colouring, in the harsh tone of its voice, and undulatory flight,\\ntold me plainly of its close blood-relationship to our common species;\\nyet it is a woodpecker which never climbs a tree!', 'Petrels are the most aerial and oceanic of birds, yet in the quiet\\nSounds of Tierra del Fuego, the Puffinuria berardi, in its general\\nhabits, in its astonishing power of diving, its manner of swimming, and\\nof flying when unwillingly it takes flight, would be mistaken by any one\\nfor an auk or grebe; nevertheless, it is essentially a petrel, but with\\nmany parts of its organisation profoundly modified.', 'On the other hand,\\nthe acutest observer by examining the dead body of the water-ouzel would\\nnever have suspected its sub-aquatic habits; yet this anomalous\\nmember of the strictly terrestrial thrush family wholly subsists by\\ndiving,--grasping the stones with its feet and using its wings under\\nwater.', 'He who believes that each being has been created as we now see it, must\\noccasionally have felt surprise when he has met with an animal having\\nhabits and structure not at all in agreement.', 'What can be plainer than\\nthat the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming?', 'yet\\nthere are upland geese with webbed feet which rarely or never go near\\nthe water; and no one except Audubon has seen the frigate-bird, which\\nhas all its four toes webbed, alight on the surface of the sea.', 'On the\\nother hand, grebes and coots are eminently aquatic, although their toes\\nare only bordered by membrane.', 'What seems plainer than that the long\\ntoes of grallatores are formed for walking over swamps and floating\\nplants, yet the water-hen is nearly as aquatic as the coot; and the\\nlandrail nearly as terrestrial as the quail or partridge.', 'In such\\ncases, and many others could be given, habits have changed without a\\ncorresponding change of structure.', 'The webbed feet of the upland goose\\nmay be said to have become rudimentary in function, though not in\\nstructure.', 'In the frigate-bird, the deeply-scooped membrane between the\\ntoes shows that structure has begun to change.', 'He who believes in separate and innumerable acts of creation will say,\\nthat in these cases it has pleased the Creator to cause a being of one\\ntype to take the place of one of another type; but this seems to me\\nonly restating the fact in dignified language.', 'He who believes in the\\nstruggle for existence and in the principle of natural selection, will\\nacknowledge that every organic being is constantly endeavouring to\\nincrease in numbers; and that if any one being vary ever so little,\\neither in habits or structure, and thus gain an advantage over some\\nother inhabitant of the country, it will seize on the place of that\\ninhabitant, however different it may be from its own place.', 'Hence it\\nwill cause him no surprise that there should be geese and frigate-birds\\nwith webbed feet, either living on the dry land or most rarely alighting\\non the water; that there should be long-toed corncrakes living in\\nmeadows instead of in swamps; that there should be woodpeckers where not\\na tree grows; that there should be diving thrushes, and petrels with the\\nhabits of auks.', 'ORGANS OF EXTREME PERFECTION AND COMPLICATION.', 'To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for\\nadjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different\\namounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic\\naberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely\\nconfess, absurd in the highest possible degree.', 'Yet reason tells me,\\nthat if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very\\nimperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be\\nshown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and\\nthe variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and if any\\nvariation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under\\nchanging conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a\\nperfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though\\ninsuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real.', 'How a\\nnerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than how\\nlife itself first originated; but I may remark that several facts make\\nme suspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered sensitive to light,\\nand likewise to those coarser vibrations of the air which produce sound.', 'In looking for the gradations by which an organ in any species has been\\nperfected, we ought to look exclusively to its lineal ancestors; but\\nthis is scarcely ever possible, and we are forced in each case to look\\nto species of the same group, that is to the collateral descendants\\nfrom the same original parent-form, in order to see what gradations are\\npossible, and for the chance of some gradations having been transmitted\\nfrom the earlier stages of descent, in an unaltered or little altered\\ncondition.', 'Amongst existing Vertebrata, we find but a small amount of\\ngradation in the structure of the eye, and from fossil species we can\\nlearn nothing on this head.', 'In this great class we should probably\\nhave to descend far beneath the lowest known fossiliferous stratum to\\ndiscover the earlier stages, by which the eye has been perfected.', 'In the Articulata we can commence a series with an optic nerve merely\\ncoated with pigment, and without any other mechanism; and from this\\nlow stage, numerous gradations of structure, branching off in two\\nfundamentally different lines, can be shown to exist, until we reach\\na moderately high stage of perfection.', 'In certain crustaceans, for\\ninstance, there is a double cornea, the inner one divided into\\nfacets, within each of which there is a lens-shaped swelling.', 'In other\\ncrustaceans the transparent cones which are coated by pigment, and which\\nproperly act only by excluding lateral pencils of light, are convex at\\ntheir upper ends and must act by convergence; and at their lower ends\\nthere seems to be an imperfect vitreous substance.', 'With these facts,\\nhere far too briefly and imperfectly given, which show that there is\\nmuch graduated diversity in the eyes of living crustaceans, and bearing\\nin mind how small the number of living animals is in proportion to those\\nwhich have become extinct, I can see no very great difficulty (not more\\nthan in the case of many other structures) in believing that natural\\nselection has converted the simple apparatus of an optic nerve merely\\ncoated with pigment and invested by transparent membrane, into an\\noptical instrument as perfect as is possessed by any member of the great\\nArticulate class.', 'He who will go thus far, if he find on finishing this treatise that\\nlarge bodies of facts, otherwise inexplicable, can be explained by the\\ntheory of descent, ought not to hesitate to go further, and to admit\\nthat a structure even as perfect as the eye of an eagle might be formed\\nby natural selection, although in this case he does not know any of the\\ntransitional grades.', 'His reason ought to conquer his imagination; though\\nI have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at any degree\\nof hesitation in extending the principle of natural selection to such\\nstartling lengths.', 'It is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a telescope.', 'We know that this instrument has been perfected by the long-continued\\nefforts of the highest human intellects;

and carefully selecting\\neach alteration which, under varied circumstances, may in any way, or in\\nany degree, tend to produce a distincter image.', 'We must suppose each new\\nstate of the instrument to be multiplied by the million; and each to\\nbe preserved till a better be produced, and then the old ones to\\nbe destroyed.', 'In living bodies, variation will cause the slight\\nalterations, generation will multiply them almost infinitely, and\\nnatural selection will pick out with unerring skill each improvement.', 'Let this process go on for millions on millions of years; and during\\neach year on millions of individuals of many kinds; and may we not\\nbelieve that a living optical instrument might thus be formed as\\nsuperior to one of glass, as the works of the Creator are to those of\\nman?', 'If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which\\ncould not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight\\nmodifications, my theory would absolutely break down.', 'But I can find\\nout no such case.', 'No doubt many organs exist of which we do not know\\nthe transitional grades, more especially if we look to much-isolated\\nspecies, round which, according to my theory, there has been much\\nextinction.', 'Or again, if we look to an organ common to all the members\\nof a large class, for in this latter case the organ must have been first\\nformed at an extremely remote period, since which all the many members\\nof the class have been developed; and in order to discover the early\\ntransitional grades through which the organ has passed, we should have\\nto look to very ancient ancestral forms, long since become extinct.', 'We should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ could not\\nhave been formed by transitional gradations of some kind.', 'Numerous cases\\ncould be given amongst the lower animals of the same organ performing\\nat the same time wholly distinct functions; thus the alimentary canal\\nrespires, digests, and excretes in the larva of the dragon-fly and in\\nthe fish Cobites.', 'In the Hydra, the animal may be turned inside out, and\\nthe exterior surface will then digest and the stomach respire.', 'In such\\ncases natural selection might easily specialise, if any advantage were\\nthus gained, a part or organ, which had performed two functions, for one\\nfunction alone, and thus wholly change its nature by insensible steps.', 'Two distinct organs sometimes perform simultaneously the same function\\nin the same individual; to give one instance, there are fish with gills\\nor branchiae that breathe the air dissolved in the water, at the same\\ntime that they breathe free air in their swimbladders, this latter organ\\nhaving a ductus pneumaticus for its supply, and being divided by highly\\nvascular partitions.', 'In these cases, one of the two organs might with\\nease be modified and perfected so as to perform all the work by itself,\\nbeing aided during the process of modification by the other organ;\\nand then this other organ might be modified for some other and quite\\ndistinct purpose, or be quite obliterated.', 'The illustration of the swimbladder in fishes is a good one, because\\nit shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally\\nconstructed for one purpose, namely flotation, may be converted into one\\nfor a wholly different purpose, namely respiration.', 'The swimbladder has,\\nalso, been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs of certain\\nfish, or, for I do not know which view is now generally held, a part\\nof the auditory apparatus has been worked in as a complement to the\\nswimbladder.', 'All physiologists admit that the swimbladder is homologous,\\nor \"ideally similar,\" in position and structure with the lungs of\\nthe higher vertebrate animals: hence there seems to me to be no great\\ndifficulty in believing that natural selection has actually converted a\\nswimbladder into a lung, or organ used exclusively for respiration.', 'I can, indeed, hardly doubt that all vertebrate animals having true\\nlungs have descended by ordinary generation from an ancient prototype,\\nof which we know nothing, furnished with a floating apparatus or\\nswimbladder.', \"We can thus, as I infer from Professor Owen's interesting\\ndescription of these parts, understand the strange fact that every\\nparticle of food and drink which we swallow has to pass over the\\norifice of the trachea, with some risk of falling into the lungs,\\nnotwithstanding the beautiful contrivance by which the glottis\\nis closed.\", 'In the higher Vertebrata the branchiae have wholly\\ndisappeared--the slits on the sides of the neck and the loop-like course\\nof the arteries still marking in the embryo their former position.', 'But\\nit is conceivable that the now utterly lost branchiae might have\\nbeen gradually worked in by natural selection for some quite distinct\\npurpose: in the same manner as, on the view entertained by some\\nnaturalists that the branchiae and dorsal scales of Annelids are\\nhomologous with the wings and wing-covers of insects, it is probable\\nthat organs which at a very ancient period served for respiration have\\nbeen actually converted into organs of flight.', 'In considering transitions of organs, it is so important to bear in mind\\nthe probability of conversion from one function to another, that I will\\ngive one more instance.', 'Pedunculated cirripedes have two minute folds of\\nskin, called by me the ovigerous frena, which serve, through the means\\nof a sticky secretion, to retain the eggs until they are hatched within\\nthe sack.', 'These cirripedes have no branchiae, the whole surface of the\\nbody and sack, including the small frena, serving for respiration.', 'The\\nBalanidae or sessile cirripedes, on the other hand, have no ovigerous\\nfrena, the eggs lying loose at the bottom of the sack, in the\\nwell-enclosed shell; but they have large folded branchiae.', 'Now I think\\nno one will dispute that the ovigerous frena in the one family are\\nstrictly homologous with the branchiae of the other family; indeed, they\\ngraduate into each other.', 'Therefore I do not doubt that little folds of\\nskin, which originally served as ovigerous frena, but which, likewise,\\nvery slightly aided the act of respiration, have been gradually\\nconverted by natural selection into branchiae, simply through an\\nincrease in their size and the obliteration of their adhesive glands.', 'If all pedunculated cirripedes had become extinct, and they have already\\nsuffered far more extinction than have sessile cirripedes, who would\\never have imagined that the branchiae in this latter family had\\noriginally existed as organs for preventing the ova from being washed\\nout of the sack?', 'Although we must be extremely cautious in concluding that any organ\\ncould not possibly have been produced by successive transitional\\ngradations, yet, undoubtedly, grave cases of difficulty occur, some of\\nwhich will be discussed in my future work.', 'One of the gravest is that of neuter insects, which are often very\\ndifferently constructed from either the males or fertile females; but\\nthis case will be treated of in the next chapter.', 'The electric organs\\nof fishes offer another case of special difficulty; it is impossible to\\nconceive by what steps these wondrous organs have been produced; but,\\nas Owen and others have remarked, their intimate structure closely\\nresembles that of common muscle; and as it has lately been shown that\\nRays have an organ closely analogous to the electric apparatus, and yet\\ndo not, as Matteuchi asserts, discharge any electricity, we must own\\nthat we are far too ignorant to argue that no transition of any kind is\\npossible.', 'The electric organs offer another and even more serious difficulty; for\\nthey occur in only about a dozen fishes, of which several are widely\\nremote in their affinities.', 'Generally when the same organ appears in\\nseveral members of the same class, especially if in members having very\\ndifferent habits of life, we may attribute its presence to inheritance\\nfrom a common ancestor; and its absence in some of the members to its\\nloss through disuse or natural selection.', 'But if the electric organs had\\nbeen inherited from one ancient progenitor thus provided, we might have\\nexpected that all electric fishes would have been specially related to\\neach other.', 'Nor does geology at all lead to the belief that formerly\\nmost fishes had electric organs, which most of their modified\\ndescendants have lost.', 'The presence of luminous organs in a few insects,\\nbelonging to different families and orders, offers a parallel case of\\ndifficulty.', 'Other cases could be given; for instance in plants, the very\\ncurious contrivance of a mass of pollen-grains, borne on a\\nfoot-stalk with a sticky gland at the end, is the same in Orchis and\\nAsclepias,--genera almost as remote as possible amongst flowering\\nplants.', 'In all these cases of two very distinct species furnished\\nwith apparently the same anomalous organ, it should be observed that,\\nalthough the general appearance and function of the organ may be the\\nsame, yet some fundamental difference can generally be detected.', 'I\\nam inclined to believe that in nearly the same way as two men have\\nsometimes independently hit on the very same invention, so natural\\nselection, working for the good of each being and taking advantage of\\nanalogous variations, has sometimes modified in very nearly the same\\nmanner two parts in two organic beings, which owe but little of their\\nstructure in common to inheritance from the same ancestor.', 'Although in many cases it is most difficult to conjecture by what\\ntransitions an organ could have arrived at its present state; yet,\\nconsidering that the proportion of living and known forms to the extinct\\nand unknown is very small, I have been astonished how rarely an organ\\ncan be named, towards which no transitional grade is known to lead.', 'The truth of this remark is indeed shown by that old canon in natural\\nhistory of \"Natura non facit saltum.\"', 'We meet with this admission in the\\nwritings of almost every experienced naturalist; or, as Milne Edwards\\nhas well expressed it, nature is prodigal in variety, but niggard in\\ninnovation.', 'Why, on the theory of Creation, should this be so?', 'Why\\nshould all the parts and organs of many independent beings, each\\nsupposed to have been separately created for its proper place in nature,\\nbe so invariably linked together by graduated steps?', 'Why should not\\nNature have taken a leap from structure to structure?', 'On the theory of\\nnatural selection, we can clearly understand why she should not; for\\nnatural selection can act only by taking advantage of slight successive\\nvariations; she can never take a leap, but must advance by the shortest\\nand slowest steps.', 'ORGANS OF LITTLE APPARENT IMPORTANCE.', 'As natural selection acts by life and death,--by the preservation of\\nindividuals with any favourable variation, and by the destruction of\\nthose with any unfavourable deviation of structure,--I have sometimes\\nfelt much difficulty in understanding the origin of simple parts, of\\nwhich the importance does not seem sufficient to cause the preservation\\nof successively varying individuals.', 'I have sometimes felt as much\\ndifficulty, though of a very different kind, on this head, as in the\\ncase of an organ as perfect and complex as the eye.', 'In the first place, we are much too ignorant in regard to the whole\\neconomy of any one organic being, to say what slight modifications would\\nbe of importance or not.', 'In a former chapter I have given instances of\\nmost trifling characters, such as the down on fruit and the colour of\\nthe flesh, which, from determining the attacks of insects or from being\\ncorrelated with constitutional differences, might assuredly be acted on\\nby natural selection.', 'The tail of the giraffe looks like an artificially\\nconstructed fly-flapper; and it seems at first incredible that this\\ncould have been adapted for its present purpose by successive slight\\nmodifications, each better and better, for so trifling an object as\\ndriving away flies; yet we should pause before being too positive even\\nin this case, for we know that the distribution and existence of cattle\\nand other animals in South America absolutely depends on their power of\\nresisting the attacks of insects: so that individuals which could by any\\nmeans defend themselves from these small enemies, would be able to range\\ninto new pastures and thus gain a great advantage.', 'It is not that the\\nlarger quadrupeds are actually destroyed (except in some rare cases) by\\nthe flies, but they are incessantly harassed and their strength reduced,\\nso that they are more subject to disease, or not so well enabled in a\\ncoming dearth to search for food, or to escape from beasts of prey.', 'Organs now of trifling importance have probably in some cases been of\\nhigh importance to an early progenitor, and, after having been slowly\\nperfected at a former period, have been transmitted in nearly the\\nsame state, although now become of very slight use; and any actually\\ninjurious deviations in their structure will always have been checked by\\nnatural selection.', 'Seeing how important an organ of locomotion the\\ntail is in most aquatic animals, its general presence and use for many\\npurposes in so many land animals, which in their lungs or modified\\nswim-bladders betray their aquatic origin, may perhaps be thus accounted\\nfor.', 'A well-developed tail having been formed in an aquatic animal, it\\nmight subsequently come to be worked in for all sorts of purposes, as\\na fly-flapper, an organ of prehension, or as an aid in turning, as with\\nthe dog, though the aid must be slight, for the hare, with hardly any\\ntail, can double quickly enough.', 'In the second place, we may sometimes attribute importance to characters\\nwhich are really of very little importance, and which have originated\\nfrom quite secondary causes, independently of natural selection.', 'We\\nshould remember that climate, food, etc., probably have some little\\ndirect influence on the organisation; that characters reappear from\\nthe law of reversion; that correlation of growth will have had a most\\nimportant influence in modifying various structures; and finally,\\nthat sexual selection will often have largely modified the external\\ncharacters of animals having a will, to give one male an advantage\\nin fighting with another or in charming the females.', 'Moreover when a\\nmodification of structure has primarily arisen from the above or\\nother unknown causes, it may at first have been of no advantage to\\nthe species, but may subsequently have been taken advantage of by the\\ndescendants of the species under new conditions of life and with newly\\nacquired habits.', 'To give a few instances to illustrate these latter remarks.', 'If green\\nwoodpeckers alone had existed, and we did not know that there were many\\nblack and pied kinds, I dare say that we should have thought that the\\ngreen colour was a beautiful adaptation to hide this tree-frequenting\\nbird from its enemies; and consequently that it was a character of\\nimportance and might have been acquired through natural selection; as it\\nis, I have no doubt that the colour is due to some quite distinct cause,\\nprobably to sexual selection.', 'A trailing bamboo in the Malay Archipelago\\nclimbs the loftiest trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks\\nclustered around the ends of the branches, and this contrivance, no\\ndoubt, is of the highest service to the plant; but as we see nearly\\nsimilar hooks on many trees which are not climbers, the hooks on the\\nbamboo may have arisen from unknown laws of growth, and have been\\nsubsequently taken advantage of by the plant undergoing further\\nmodification and becoming a climber.', 'The naked skin on the head of a\\nvulture is generally looked at as a direct adaptation for wallowing in\\nputridity; and so it may be, or it may possibly be due to the direct\\naction of putrid matter; but we should be very cautious in drawing\\nany such inference, when we see that the skin on the head of the\\nclean-feeding male turkey is likewise naked.', 'The sutures in the skulls\\nof young mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aiding\\nparturition, and no doubt they facilitate, or may be indispensable\\nfor this act; but as sutures occur in the skulls of young birds and\\nreptiles, which have only to escape from a broken egg, we may infer that\\nthis structure has arisen from the laws of growth, and has been taken\\nadvantage of in the parturition of the higher animals.', 'We are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and\\nunimportant variations; and we are immediately made conscious of this by\\nreflecting on the differences in the breeds of our domesticated animals\\nin different countries,--more especially in the less civilized countries\\nwhere there has been but little artificial selection.', 'Careful observers\\nare convinced that a damp climate affects the growth of the hair, and\\nthat with the hair the horns are correlated.', 'Mountain breeds always\\ndiffer from lowland breeds; and a mountainous country would probably\\naffect the hind limbs from exercising them more, and possibly even the\\nform of the pelvis; and then by the law of homologous variation, the\\nfront limbs and even the head would probably be affected.', 'The shape,\\nalso, of the pelvis might affect by pressure the shape of the head of\\nthe young in the womb.', 'The laborious breathing necessary in high regions\\nwould, we have some reason to believe, increase the size of the chest;\\nand again correlation would come into play.', 'Animals kept by savages in\\ndifferent countries often have to struggle for their own subsistence,\\nand would be exposed to a certain extent to natural selection, and\\nindividuals with slightly different constitutions would succeed\\nbest under different climates; and there is reason to believe that\\nconstitution and colour are correlated.', 'A good observer, also, states\\nthat in cattle susceptibility to the attacks of flies is correlated with\\ncolour, as is the liability to be poisoned by certain plants; so that\\ncolour would be thus subjected to the action of natural selection.', 'But\\nwe are far too ignorant to speculate on the relative importance of the\\nseveral known and unknown laws of variation; and I have here alluded\\nto them only to show that, if we are unable to account for the\\ncharacteristic differences of our domestic breeds, which nevertheless we\\ngenerally admit to have arisen through ordinary generation, we ought\\nnot to lay too much stress on our ignorance of the precise cause of the\\nslight analogous differences between species.', 'I might have adduced for\\nthis same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are\\nso strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently\\nbe thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual\\nselection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious\\ndetails my reasoning would appear frivolous.', 'The foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest lately\\nmade by some naturalists, against the utilitarian doctrine that every\\ndetail of structure has been produced for the good of its possessor.', 'They believe that very many structures have been created for beauty in\\nthe eyes of man, or for mere variety.', 'This doctrine, if true, would be\\nabsolutely fatal to my theory.', 'Yet I fully admit that many structures\\nare of no direct use to their possessors.', 'Physical conditions probably\\nhave had some little effect on structure, quite independently of any\\ngood thus gained.', 'Correlation of growth has no doubt played a most\\nimportant part, and a useful modification of one part will often have\\nentailed on other parts diversified changes of no direct use.', 'So again\\ncharacters which formerly were useful, or which formerly had arisen from\\ncorrelation of growth, or from other unknown cause, may reappear from\\nthe law of reversion, though now of no direct use.', 'The effects of sexual\\nselection, when displayed in beauty to charm the females, can be called\\nuseful only in rather a forced sense.', 'But by far the most important\\nconsideration is that the chief part of the organisation of every\\nbeing is simply due to inheritance; and consequently, though each being\\nassuredly is well fitted for its place in nature, many structures now\\nhave no direct relation to the habits of life of each species.', 'Thus, we\\ncan hardly believe that the webbed feet of the upland goose or of the\\nfrigate-bird are of special use to these birds; we cannot believe that\\nthe same bones in the arm of the monkey, in the fore leg of the horse,\\nin the wing of the bat, and in the flipper of the seal, are of special\\nuse to these animals.', 'We may safely attribute these structures to\\ninheritance.', 'But to the progenitor of the upland goose and of the\\nfrigate-bird, webbed feet no doubt were as useful as they now are to the\\nmost aquatic of existing birds.', 'So we may believe that the progenitor of\\nthe seal had not a flipper, but a foot with five toes fitted for walking\\nor grasping; and we may further venture to believe that the several\\nbones in the limbs of the monkey, horse, and bat, which have been\\ninherited from a common progenitor, were formerly of more special use to\\nthat progenitor, or its progenitors, than they now are to these animals\\nhaving such widely diversified habits.', 'Therefore we may infer that\\nthese several bones might have been acquired through natural selection,\\nsubjected formerly, as now, to the several laws of inheritance,\\nreversion, correlation of growth, etc.', 'Hence every detail of structure\\nin every living creature (making some little allowance for the direct\\naction of physical conditions) may be viewed, either as having been of\\nspecial use to some ancestral form, or as being now of special use to\\nthe descendants of this form--either directly, or indirectly through the\\ncomplex laws of growth.', 'Natural selection cannot possibly produce any modification in any one\\nspecies exclusively for the good of another species; though throughout\\nnature one species incessantly takes advantage of, and profits by, the\\nstructure of another.', 'But natural selection can and does often produce\\nstructures for the direct injury of other species, as we see in the fang\\nof the adder, and in the ovipositor of the ichneumon, by which its eggs\\nare deposited in the living bodies of other insects.', 'If it could be\\nproved that any part of the structure of any one species had been\\nformed for the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my\\ntheory, for such could not have been produced through natural selection.', 'Although many statements may be found in works on natural history to\\nthis effect, I cannot find even one which seems to me of any weight.', 'It\\nis admitted that the rattlesnake has a poison-fang for its own defence\\nand for the destruction of its prey;

but I think that in the discussion light has been thrown on\\nseveral facts, which on the theory of independent acts of creation are\\nutterly obscure.', 'We have seen that species at any one period are not\\nindefinitely variable, and are not linked together by a multitude of\\nintermediate gradations, partly because the process of natural selection\\nwill always be very slow, and will act, at any one time, only on a very\\nfew forms;

but from reasons assigned, the\\nintermediate variety will usually exist in lesser numbers than the two\\nforms which it connects; consequently the two latter, during the course\\nof further modification, from existing in greater numbers, will have a\\ngreat advantage over the less numerous intermediate variety, and will\\nthus generally succeed in supplanting and exterminating it.', 'We have seen in this chapter how cautious we should be in concluding\\nthat the most different habits of life could not graduate into each\\nother;

and another\\nkind of wolf rushing round, instead of at, a herd of deer, and driving\\nthem to a distant point, we should assuredly call these actions\\ninstinctive.', 'Domestic instincts, as they may be called, are certainly\\nfar less fixed or invariable than natural instincts; but they have been\\nacted on by far less rigorous selection, and have been transmitted for\\nan incomparably shorter period, under less fixed conditions of life.', 'How strongly these domestic instincts, habits, and dispositions are\\ninherited, and how curiously they become mingled, is well shown when\\ndifferent breeds of dogs are crossed.', 'Thus it is known that a cross with\\na bull-dog has affected for many generations the courage and obstinacy\\nof greyhounds; and a cross with a greyhound has given to a whole family\\nof shepherd-dogs a tendency to hunt hares.', 'These domestic instincts,\\nwhen thus tested by crossing, resemble natural instincts, which in a\\nlike manner become curiously blended together, and for a long period\\nexhibit traces of the instincts of either parent: for example, Le Roy\\ndescribes a dog, whose great-grandfather was a wolf, and this dog\\nshowed a trace of its wild parentage only in one way, by not coming in a\\nstraight line to his master when called.', 'Domestic instincts are sometimes spoken of as actions which have become\\ninherited solely from long-continued and compulsory habit, but this,\\nI think, is not true.', 'No one would ever have thought of teaching, or\\nprobably could have taught, the tumbler-pigeon to tumble,--an action\\nwhich, as I have witnessed, is performed by young birds, that have\\nnever seen a pigeon tumble.', 'We may believe that some one pigeon showed\\na slight tendency to this strange habit, and that the long-continued\\nselection of the best individuals in successive generations made\\ntumblers what they now are; and near Glasgow there are house-tumblers,\\nas I hear from Mr. Brent, which cannot fly eighteen inches high without\\ngoing head over heels.', 'It may be doubted whether any one would have\\nthought of training a dog to point, had not some one dog naturally shown\\na tendency in this line; and this is known occasionally to happen, as I\\nonce saw in a pure terrier.', 'When the first tendency was once displayed,\\nmethodical selection and the inherited effects of compulsory training in\\neach successive generation would soon complete the work; and unconscious\\nselection is still at work, as each man tries to procure, without\\nintending to improve the breed, dogs which will stand and hunt best.', 'On the other hand, habit alone in some cases has sufficed; no animal is\\nmore difficult to tame than the young of the wild rabbit; scarcely any\\nanimal is tamer than the young of the tame rabbit; but I do not suppose\\nthat domestic rabbits have ever been selected for tameness; and I\\npresume that we must attribute the whole of the inherited change from\\nextreme wildness to extreme tameness, simply to habit and long-continued\\nclose confinement.', 'Natural instincts are lost under domestication: a remarkable instance of\\nthis is seen in those breeds of fowls which very rarely or never become\\n\"broody,\" that is, never wish to sit on their eggs.', 'Familiarity alone\\nprevents our seeing how universally and largely the minds of our\\ndomestic animals have been modified by domestication.', 'It is scarcely\\npossible to doubt that the love of man has become instinctive in the\\ndog.', 'All wolves, foxes, jackals, and species of the cat genus, when\\nkept tame, are most eager to attack poultry, sheep, and pigs; and this\\ntendency has been found incurable in dogs which have been brought home\\nas puppies from countries, such as Tierra del Fuego and Australia, where\\nthe savages do not keep these domestic animals.', 'How rarely, on the other\\nhand, do our civilised dogs, even when quite young, require to be taught\\nnot to attack poultry, sheep, and pigs!', 'No doubt they occasionally\\ndo make an attack, and are then beaten; and if not cured, they are\\ndestroyed; so that habit, with some degree of selection, has probably\\nconcurred in civilising by inheritance our dogs.', 'On the other hand,\\nyoung chickens have lost, wholly by habit, that fear of the dog and cat\\nwhich no doubt was originally instinctive in them, in the same way as it\\nis so plainly instinctive in young pheasants, though reared under a hen.', 'It is not that chickens have lost all fear, but fear only of dogs and\\ncats, for if the hen gives the danger-chuckle, they will run (more\\nespecially young turkeys) from under her, and conceal themselves in\\nthe surrounding grass or thickets; and this is evidently done for the\\ninstinctive purpose of allowing, as we see in wild ground-birds, their\\nmother to fly away.', 'But this instinct retained by our chickens has\\nbecome useless under domestication, for the mother-hen has almost lost\\nby disuse the power of flight.', 'Hence, we may conclude, that domestic instincts have been acquired and\\nnatural instincts have been lost partly by habit, and partly by man\\nselecting and accumulating during successive generations, peculiar\\nmental habits and actions, which at first appeared from what we must in\\nour ignorance call an accident.', 'In some cases compulsory habit alone\\nhas sufficed to produce such inherited mental changes; in other cases\\ncompulsory habit has done nothing, and all has been the result of\\nselection, pursued both methodically and unconsciously; but in most\\ncases, probably, habit and selection have acted together.', 'We shall, perhaps, best understand how instincts in a state of nature\\nhave become modified by selection, by considering a few cases.', \"I will\\nselect only three, out of the several which I shall have to discuss in\\nmy future work,--namely, the instinct which leads the cuckoo to lay her\\neggs in other birds' nests; the slave-making instinct of certain ants;\\nand the comb-making power of the hive-bee: these two latter instincts\\nhave generally, and most justly, been ranked by naturalists as the most\\nwonderful of all known instincts.\", \"It is now commonly admitted that the more immediate and final cause\\nof the cuckoo's instinct is, that she lays her eggs, not daily, but at\\nintervals of two or three days; so that, if she were to make her own\\nnest and sit on her own eggs, those first laid would have to be left\\nfor some time unincubated, or there would be eggs and young birds of\\ndifferent ages in the same nest.\", 'If this were the case, the process of\\nlaying and hatching might be inconveniently long, more especially as she\\nhas to migrate at a very early period; and the first hatched young would\\nprobably have to be fed by the male alone.', 'But the American cuckoo is\\nin this predicament; for she makes her own nest and has eggs and young\\nsuccessively hatched, all at the same time.', \"It has been asserted that\\nthe American cuckoo occasionally lays her eggs in other birds' nests;\\nbut I hear on the high authority of Dr.\", 'Brewer, that this is a mistake.', \"Nevertheless, I could give several instances of various birds which have\\nbeen known occasionally to lay their eggs in other birds' nests.\", \"Now let\\nus suppose that the ancient progenitor of our European cuckoo had the\\nhabits of the American cuckoo; but that occasionally she laid an egg in\\nanother bird's nest.\", \"If the old bird profited by this occasional habit,\\nor if the young were made more vigorous by advantage having been taken\\nof the mistaken maternal instinct of another bird, than by their own\\nmother's care, encumbered as she can hardly fail to be by having eggs\\nand young of different ages at the same time; then the old birds or the\\nfostered young would gain an advantage.\", \"And analogy would lead me\\nto believe, that the young thus reared would be apt to follow by\\ninheritance the occasional and aberrant habit of their mother, and in\\ntheir turn would be apt to lay their eggs in other birds' nests, and\\nthus be successful in rearing their young.\", 'By a continued process of\\nthis nature, I believe that the strange instinct of our cuckoo could be,\\nand has been, generated.', 'I may add that, according to Dr. Gray and\\nto some other observers, the European cuckoo has not utterly lost all\\nmaternal love and care for her own offspring.', \"The occasional habit of birds laying their eggs in other birds' nests,\\neither of the same or of a distinct species, is not very uncommon with\\nthe Gallinaceae; and this perhaps explains the origin of a singular\\ninstinct in the allied group of ostriches.\", 'For several hen ostriches,\\nat least in the case of the American species, unite and lay first a\\nfew eggs in one nest and then in another; and these are hatched by the\\nmales.', 'This instinct may probably be accounted for by the fact of the\\nhens laying a large number of eggs; but, as in the case of the cuckoo,\\nat intervals of two or three days.', \"This instinct, however, of the\\nAmerican ostrich has not as yet been perfected; for a surprising number\\nof eggs lie strewed over the plains, so that in one day's hunting I\\npicked up no less than twenty lost and wasted eggs.\", 'Many bees are parasitic, and always lay their eggs in the nests of bees\\nof other kinds.', 'This case is more remarkable than that of the cuckoo;\\nfor these bees have not only their instincts but their structure\\nmodified in accordance with their parasitic habits; for they do not\\npossess the pollen-collecting apparatus which would be necessary if\\nthey had to store food for their own young.', 'Some species, likewise, of\\nSphegidae (wasp-like insects) are parasitic on other species; and M.\\nFabre has lately shown good reason for believing that although the\\nTachytes nigra generally makes its own burrow and stores it with\\nparalysed prey for its own larvae to feed on, yet that when this insect\\nfinds a burrow already made and stored by another sphex, it takes\\nadvantage of the prize, and becomes for the occasion parasitic.', 'In this\\ncase, as with the supposed case of the cuckoo, I can see no difficulty\\nin natural selection making an occasional habit permanent, if of\\nadvantage to the species, and if the insect whose nest and stored food\\nare thus feloniously appropriated, be not thus exterminated.', 'SLAVE-MAKING INSTINCT.', 'This remarkable instinct was first discovered in the Formica (Polyerges)\\nrufescens by Pierre Huber, a better observer even than his celebrated\\nfather.', 'This ant is absolutely dependent on its slaves; without their\\naid, the species would certainly become extinct in a single year.', 'The\\nmales and fertile females do no work.', 'The workers or sterile females,\\nthough most energetic and courageous in capturing slaves, do no other\\nwork.', 'They are incapable of making their own nests, or of feeding their\\nown larvae.', 'When the old nest is found inconvenient, and they have to\\nmigrate, it is the slaves which determine the migration, and actually\\ncarry their masters in their jaws.', 'So utterly helpless are the masters,\\nthat when Huber shut up thirty of them without a slave, but with plenty\\nof the food which they like best, and with their larvae and pupae to\\nstimulate them to work, they did nothing; they could not even feed\\nthemselves, and many perished of hunger.', 'Huber then introduced a single\\nslave (F. fusca), and she instantly set to work, fed and saved the\\nsurvivors; made some cells and tended the larvae, and put all to rights.', 'What can be more extraordinary than these well-ascertained facts?', 'If we\\nhad not known of any other slave-making ant, it would have been\\nhopeless to have speculated how so wonderful an instinct could have been\\nperfected.', 'Formica sanguinea was likewise first discovered by P. Huber to be\\na slave-making ant.', 'This species is found in the southern parts of\\nEngland, and its habits have been attended to by Mr. F. Smith, of the\\nBritish Museum, to whom I am much indebted for information on this and\\nother subjects.', 'Although fully trusting to the statements of Huber and\\nMr. Smith, I tried to approach the subject in a sceptical frame of\\nmind, as any one may well be excused for doubting the truth of so\\nextraordinary and odious an instinct as that of making slaves.', 'Hence\\nI will give the observations which I have myself made, in some little\\ndetail.', 'I opened fourteen nests of F. sanguinea, and found a few slaves\\nin all.', 'Males and fertile females of the slave-species are found only in\\ntheir own proper communities, and have never been observed in the nests\\nof F. sanguinea.', 'The slaves are black and not above half the size of\\ntheir red masters, so that the contrast in their appearance is very\\ngreat.', 'When the nest is slightly disturbed, the slaves occasionally come\\nout, and like their masters are much agitated and defend the nest: when\\nthe nest is much disturbed and the larvae and pupae are exposed, the\\nslaves work energetically with their masters in carrying them away to a\\nplace of safety.', 'Hence, it is clear, that the slaves feel quite at home.', 'During the months of June and July, on three successive years, I have\\nwatched for many hours several nests in Surrey and Sussex, and never\\nsaw a slave either leave or enter a nest.', 'As, during these months,\\nthe slaves are very few in number, I thought that they might behave\\ndifferently when more numerous; but Mr. Smith informs me that he has\\nwatched the nests at various hours during May, June and August, both in\\nSurrey and Hampshire, and has never seen the slaves, though present\\nin large numbers in August, either leave or enter the nest.', 'Hence he\\nconsiders them as strictly household slaves.', 'The masters, on the other\\nhand, may be constantly seen bringing in materials for the nest, and\\nfood of all kinds.', 'During the present year, however, in the month of\\nJuly, I came across a community with an unusually large stock of slaves,\\nand I observed a few slaves mingled with their masters leaving the nest,\\nand marching along the same road to a tall Scotch-fir-tree, twenty-five\\nyards distant, which they ascended together, probably in search of\\naphides or cocci.', 'According to Huber, who had ample opportunities\\nfor observation, in Switzerland the slaves habitually work with their\\nmasters in making the nest, and they alone open and close the doors in\\nthe morning and evening; and, as Huber expressly states, their principal\\noffice is to search for aphides.', 'This difference in the usual habits of\\nthe masters and slaves in the two countries, probably depends merely\\non the slaves being captured in greater numbers in Switzerland than in\\nEngland.', 'One day I fortunately chanced to witness a migration from one nest to\\nanother, and it was a most interesting spectacle to behold the masters\\ncarefully carrying, as Huber has described, their slaves in their jaws.', 'Another day my attention was struck by about a score of the slave-makers\\nhaunting the same spot, and evidently not in search of food; they\\napproached and were vigorously repulsed by an independent community of\\nthe slave species (F. fusca); sometimes as many as three of these\\nants clinging to the legs of the slave-making F. sanguinea.', 'The latter\\nruthlessly killed their small opponents, and carried their dead\\nbodies as food to their nest, twenty-nine yards distant; but they were\\nprevented from getting any pupae to rear as slaves.', 'I then dug up a\\nsmall parcel of the pupae of F. fusca from another nest, and put them\\ndown on a bare spot near the place of combat; they were eagerly seized,\\nand carried off by the tyrants, who perhaps fancied that, after all,\\nthey had been victorious in their late combat.', 'At the same time I laid on the same place a small parcel of the pupae of\\nanother species, F. flava, with a few of these little yellow ants still\\nclinging to the fragments of the nest.', 'This species is sometimes, though\\nrarely, made into slaves, as has been described by Mr. Smith.', 'Although so small a species, it is very courageous, and I have seen it\\nferociously attack other ants.', 'In one instance I found to my surprise\\nan independent community of F. flava under a stone beneath a nest of the\\nslave-making F. sanguinea; and when I had accidentally disturbed both\\nnests, the little ants attacked their big neighbours with surprising\\ncourage.', 'Now I was curious to ascertain whether F. sanguinea could\\ndistinguish the pupae of F. fusca, which they habitually make into\\nslaves, from those of the little and furious F. flava, which they rarely\\ncapture, and it was evident that they did at once distinguish them:\\nfor we have seen that they eagerly and instantly seized the pupae of F.\\nfusca, whereas they were much terrified when they came across the pupae,\\nor even the earth from the nest of F. flava, and quickly ran away; but\\nin about a quarter of an hour, shortly after all the little yellow ants\\nhad crawled away, they took heart and carried off the pupae.', 'One evening I visited another community of F. sanguinea, and found a\\nnumber of these ants entering their nest, carrying the dead bodies of F.\\nfusca (showing that it was not a migration) and numerous pupae.', 'I traced\\nthe returning file burthened with booty, for about forty yards, to\\na very thick clump of heath, whence I saw the last individual of F.\\nsanguinea emerge, carrying a pupa; but I was not able to find the\\ndesolated nest in the thick heath.', 'The nest, however, must have been\\nclose at hand, for two or three individuals of F. fusca were rushing\\nabout in the greatest agitation, and one was perched motionless with its\\nown pupa in its mouth on the top of a spray of heath over its ravaged\\nhome.', 'Such are the facts, though they did not need confirmation by me, in\\nregard to the wonderful instinct of making slaves.', 'Let it be observed\\nwhat a contrast the instinctive habits of F. sanguinea present with\\nthose of the F. rufescens.', 'The latter does not build its own nest, does\\nnot determine its own migrations, does not collect food for itself or\\nits young, and cannot even feed itself: it is absolutely dependent on\\nits numerous slaves.', 'Formica sanguinea, on the other hand, possesses\\nmuch fewer slaves, and in the early part of the summer extremely few.', 'The masters determine when and where a new nest shall be formed, and\\nwhen they migrate, the masters carry the slaves.', 'Both in Switzerland and\\nEngland the slaves seem to have the exclusive care of the larvae, and\\nthe masters alone go on slave-making expeditions.', 'In Switzerland the\\nslaves and masters work together, making and bringing materials for the\\nnest: both, but chiefly the slaves, tend, and milk as it may be called,\\ntheir aphides; and thus both collect food for the community.', 'In England\\nthe masters alone usually leave the nest to collect building materials\\nand food for themselves, their slaves and larvae.', 'So that the masters in\\nthis country receive much less service from their slaves than they do in\\nSwitzerland.', 'By what steps the instinct of F. sanguinea originated I will not pretend\\nto conjecture.', 'But as ants, which are not slave-makers, will, as I have\\nseen, carry off pupae of other species, if scattered near their nests,\\nit is possible that pupae originally stored as food might become\\ndeveloped; and the ants thus unintentionally reared would then follow\\ntheir proper instincts, and do what work they could.', 'If their presence\\nproved useful to the species which had seized them--if it were more\\nadvantageous to this species to capture workers than to procreate\\nthem--the habit of collecting pupae originally for food might by natural\\nselection be strengthened and rendered permanent for the very different\\npurpose of raising slaves.', 'When the instinct was once acquired, if\\ncarried out to a much less extent even than in our British F. sanguinea,\\nwhich, as we have seen, is less aided by its slaves than the same\\nspecies in Switzerland, I can see no difficulty in natural selection\\nincreasing and modifying the instinct--always supposing each\\nmodification to be of use to the species--until an ant was formed as\\nabjectly dependent on its slaves as is the Formica rufescens.', 'CELL-MAKING INSTINCT OF THE HIVE-BEE.', 'I will not here enter on minute details on this subject, but will merely\\ngive an outline of the conclusions at which I have arrived.', 'He must be\\na dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a comb, so\\nbeautifully adapted to its end, without enthusiastic admiration.', 'We\\nhear from mathematicians that bees have practically solved a recondite\\nproblem, and have made their cells of the proper shape to hold the\\ngreatest possible amount of honey, with the least possible consumption\\nof precious wax in their construction.', 'It has been remarked that a\\nskilful workman, with fitting tools and measures, would find it\\nvery difficult to make cells of wax of the true form, though this is\\nperfectly effected by a crowd of bees working in a dark hive.', 'Grant\\nwhatever instincts you please, and it seems at first quite inconceivable\\nhow they can make all the necessary angles and planes, or even perceive\\nwhen they are correctly made.', 'But the difficulty is not nearly so great\\nas it at first appears: all this beautiful work can be shown, I think,\\nto follow from a few very simple instincts.', 'I was led to investigate this subject by Mr. Waterhouse, who has shown\\nthat the form of the cell stands in close relation to the presence of\\nadjoining cells; and the following view may, perhaps, be considered only\\nas a modification of his theory.', 'Let us look to the great principle of\\ngradation, and see whether Nature does not reveal to us her method of\\nwork.', 'At one end of a short series we have humble-bees, which use their\\nold cocoons to hold honey, sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax,\\nand likewise making separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax.', 'At\\nthe other end of the series we have the cells of the hive-bee, placed in\\na double layer: each cell, as is well known, is an hexagonal prism, with\\nthe basal edges of its six sides bevelled so as to join on to a pyramid,\\nformed of three rhombs.', 'These rhombs have certain angles, and the three\\nwhich form the pyramidal base of a single cell on one side of the comb,\\nenter into the composition of the bases of three adjoining cells on the\\nopposite side.', 'In the series between the extreme perfection of the cells\\nof the hive-bee and the simplicity of those of the humble-bee, we have\\nthe cells of the Mexican Melipona domestica, carefully described\\nand figured by Pierre Huber.', 'The Melipona itself is intermediate in\\nstructure between the hive and humble bee, but more nearly related to\\nthe latter: it forms a nearly regular waxen comb of cylindrical cells,\\nin which the young are hatched, and, in addition, some large cells of\\nwax for holding honey.', 'These latter cells are nearly spherical and of\\nnearly equal sizes, and are aggregated into an irregular mass.', 'But the\\nimportant point to notice, is that these cells are always made at that\\ndegree of nearness to each other, that they would have intersected or\\nbroken into each other, if the spheres had been completed; but this is\\nnever permitted, the bees building perfectly flat walls of wax between\\nthe spheres which thus tend to intersect.', 'Hence each cell consists of\\nan outer spherical portion and of two, three, or more perfectly flat\\nsurfaces, according as the cell adjoins two, three or more other cells.', 'When one cell comes into contact with three other cells, which, from\\nthe spheres being nearly of the same size, is very frequently and\\nnecessarily the case, the three flat surfaces are united into a pyramid;\\nand this pyramid, as Huber has remarked, is manifestly a gross imitation\\nof the three-sided pyramidal basis of the cell of the hive-bee.', 'As in\\nthe cells of the hive-bee, so here, the three plane surfaces in any one\\ncell necessarily enter into the construction of three adjoining cells.', 'It is obvious that the Melipona saves wax by this manner of building;\\nfor the flat walls between the adjoining cells are not double, but are\\nof the same thickness as the outer spherical portions, and yet each flat\\nportion forms a part of two cells.', 'Reflecting on this case, it occurred to me that if the Melipona had made\\nits spheres at some given distance from each other, and had made them of\\nequal sizes and had arranged them symmetrically in a double layer, the\\nresulting structure would probably have been as perfect as the comb of\\nthe hive-bee.', 'Accordingly I wrote to Professor Miller, of Cambridge,\\nand this geometer has kindly read over the following statement, drawn up\\nfrom his information, and tells me that it is strictly correct:--\\n\\nIf a number of equal spheres be described with their centres placed in\\ntwo parallel layers; with the centre of each sphere at the distance of\\nradius x the square root of 2 or radius x 1.41421 (or at some lesser\\ndistance), from the centres of the six surrounding spheres in the\\nsame layer; and at the same distance from the centres of the adjoining\\nspheres in the other and parallel layer; then, if planes of intersection\\nbetween the several spheres in both layers be formed, there will result\\na double layer of hexagonal prisms united together by pyramidal bases\\nformed of three rhombs; and the rhombs and the sides of the hexagonal\\nprisms will have every angle identically the same with the best\\nmeasurements which have been made of the cells of the hive-bee.', 'Hence we may safely conclude that if we could slightly modify the\\ninstincts already possessed by the Melipona, and in themselves not very\\nwonderful, this bee would make a structure as wonderfully perfect as\\nthat of the hive-bee.', 'We must suppose the Melipona to make her cells\\ntruly spherical, and of equal sizes; and this would not be very\\nsurprising, seeing that she already does so to a certain extent, and\\nseeing what perfectly cylindrical burrows in wood many insects can\\nmake, apparently by turning round on a fixed point.', 'We must suppose the\\nMelipona to arrange her cells in level layers, as she already does her\\ncylindrical cells; and we must further suppose, and this is the greatest\\ndifficulty, that she can somehow judge accurately at what distance to\\nstand from her fellow-labourers when several are making their spheres;\\nbut she is already so far enabled to judge of distance, that she always\\ndescribes her spheres so as to intersect largely; and then she unites\\nthe points of intersection by perfectly flat surfaces.', 'We have further\\nto suppose, but this is no difficulty, that after hexagonal prisms have\\nbeen formed by the intersection of adjoining spheres in the same layer,\\nshe can prolong the hexagon to any length requisite to hold the stock of\\nhoney; in the same way as the rude humble-bee adds cylinders of wax\\nto the circular mouths of her old cocoons.', 'By such modifications of\\ninstincts in themselves not very wonderful,--hardly more wonderful than\\nthose which guide a bird to make its nest,--I believe that the hive-bee\\nhas acquired, through natural selection, her inimitable architectural\\npowers.', 'But this theory can be tested by experiment.', 'Following the example of\\nMr. Tegetmeier, I separated two combs, and put between them a long,\\nthick, square strip of wax: the bees instantly began to excavate minute\\ncircular pits in it; and as they deepened these little pits, they made\\nthem wider and wider until they were converted into shallow basins,\\nappearing to the eye perfectly true or parts of a sphere, and of about\\nthe diameter of a cell.', 'It was most interesting to me to observe that\\nwherever several bees had begun to excavate these basins near together,\\nthey had begun their work at such a distance from each other, that by\\nthe time the basins had acquired the above stated width (i.e.', 'about the\\nwidth of an ordinary cell), and were in depth about one sixth of the\\ndiameter of the sphere of which they formed a part, the rims of the\\nbasins intersected or broke into each other.', 'As soon as this occurred,\\nthe bees ceased to excavate, and began to build up flat walls of wax\\non the lines of intersection between the basins, so that each hexagonal\\nprism was built upon the festooned edge of a smooth basin, instead of on\\nthe straight edges of a three-sided pyramid as in the case of ordinary\\ncells.', 'I then put into the hive, instead of a thick, square piece of wax, a\\nthin and narrow, knife-edged ridge, coloured with vermilion.', 'The bees\\ninstantly began on both sides to excavate little basins near to each\\nother, in the same way as before; but the ridge of wax was so thin, that\\nthe bottoms of the basins, if they had been excavated to the same depth\\nas in the former experiment, would have broken into each other from the\\nopposite sides.', 'The bees, however, did not suffer this to happen, and\\nthey stopped their excavations in due time; so that the basins, as soon\\nas they had been a little deepened, came to have flat bottoms; and these\\nflat bottoms, formed by thin little plates of the vermilion wax having\\nbeen left ungnawed, were situated, as far as the eye could judge,\\nexactly along the planes of imaginary intersection between the basins on\\nthe opposite sides of the ridge of wax.', 'In parts, only little bits, in\\nother parts, large portions of a rhombic plate had been left between the\\nopposed basins, but the work, from the unnatural state of things, had\\nnot been neatly performed.', 'The bees must have worked at very nearly the\\nsame rate on the opposite sides of the ridge of vermilion wax, as they\\ncircularly gnawed away and deepened the basins on both sides, in order\\nto have succeeded in thus leaving flat plates between the basins, by\\nstopping work along the intermediate planes or planes of intersection.', 'Considering how flexible thin wax is, I do not see that there is any\\ndifficulty in the bees, whilst at work on the two sides of a strip\\nof wax, perceiving when they have gnawed the wax away to the proper\\nthinness, and then stopping their work.', 'In ordinary combs it has\\nappeared to me that the bees do not always succeed in working at exactly\\nthe same rate from the opposite sides; for I have noticed half-completed\\nrhombs at the base of a just-commenced cell, which were slightly concave\\non one side, where I suppose that the bees had excavated too quickly,\\nand convex on the opposed side, where the bees had worked less quickly.', 'In one well-marked instance, I put the comb back into the hive, and\\nallowed the bees to go on working for a short time, and again examined\\nthe cell, and I found that the rhombic plate had been completed, and had\\nbecome PERFECTLY FLAT: it was absolutely impossible, from the extreme\\nthinness of the little rhombic plate, that they could have effected this\\nby gnawing away the convex side; and I suspect that the bees in such\\ncases stand in the opposed cells and push and bend the ductile and warm\\nwax (which as I have tried is easily done) into its proper intermediate\\nplane, and thus flatten it.', 'From the experiment of the ridge of vermilion wax, we can clearly see\\nthat if the bees were to build for themselves a thin wall of wax, they\\ncould make their cells of the proper shape, by standing at the proper\\ndistance from each other, by excavating at the same rate, and by\\nendeavouring to make equal spherical hollows, but never allowing the\\nspheres to break into each other.', 'Now bees, as may be clearly seen by\\nexamining the edge of a growing comb, do make a rough, circumferential\\nwall or rim all round the comb; and they gnaw into this from the\\nopposite sides, always working circularly as they deepen each cell.', 'They\\ndo not make the whole three-sided pyramidal base of any one cell at the\\nsame time, but only the one rhombic plate which stands on the extreme\\ngrowing margin, or the two plates, as the case may be; and they never\\ncomplete the upper edges of the rhombic plates, until the hexagonal\\nwalls are commenced.', 'Some of these statements differ from those made by\\nthe justly celebrated elder Huber, but I am convinced of their accuracy;\\nand if I had space, I could show that they are conformable with my\\ntheory.', \"Huber's statement that the very first cell is excavated out of a little\\nparallel-sided wall of wax, is not, as far as I have seen, strictly\\ncorrect; the first commencement having always been a little hood of wax;\\nbut I will not here enter on these details.\", 'We see how important a part\\nexcavation plays in the construction of the cells; but it would be a\\ngreat error to suppose that the bees cannot build up a rough wall of wax\\nin the proper position--that is, along the plane of intersection between\\ntwo adjoining spheres.', 'I have several specimens showing clearly that\\nthey can do this.', 'Even in the rude circumferential rim or wall of wax\\nround a growing comb, flexures may sometimes be observed, corresponding\\nin position to the planes of the rhombic basal plates of future cells.', 'But the rough wall of wax has in every case to be finished off, by being\\nlargely gnawed away on both sides.', 'The manner in which the bees build is\\ncurious; they always make the first rough wall from ten to twenty times\\nthicker than the excessively thin finished wall of the cell, which will\\nultimately be left.', 'We shall understand how they work, by supposing\\nmasons first to pile up a broad ridge of cement, and then to begin\\ncutting it away equally on both sides near the ground, till a smooth,\\nvery thin wall is left in the middle; the masons always piling up the\\ncut-away cement, and adding fresh cement, on the summit of the ridge.', 'We\\nshall thus have a thin wall steadily growing upward; but always crowned\\nby a gigantic coping.', 'From all the cells, both those just commenced and\\nthose completed, being thus crowned by a strong coping of wax, the\\nbees can cluster and crawl over the comb without injuring the delicate\\nhexagonal walls, which are only about one four-hundredth of an inch in\\nthickness; the plates of the pyramidal basis being about twice as thick.', 'By this singular manner of building, strength is continually given to\\nthe comb, with the utmost ultimate economy of wax.', 'It seems at first to add to the difficulty of understanding how the\\ncells are made, that a multitude of bees all work together; one bee\\nafter working a short time at one cell going to another, so that, as\\nHuber has stated, a score of individuals work even at the commencement\\nof the first cell.', 'I was able practically to show this fact, by covering\\nthe edges of the hexagonal walls of a single cell, or the extreme margin\\nof the circumferential rim of a growing comb, with an extremely thin\\nlayer of melted vermilion wax; and I invariably found that the colour\\nwas most delicately diffused by the bees--as delicately as a painter\\ncould have done with his brush--by atoms of the coloured wax having been\\ntaken from the spot on which it had been placed, and worked into the\\ngrowing edges of the cells all round.', 'The work of construction seems\\nto be a sort of balance struck between many bees, all instinctively\\nstanding at the same relative distance from each other, all trying to\\nsweep equal spheres, and then building up, or leaving ungnawed, the\\nplanes of intersection between these spheres.', 'It was really curious to\\nnote in cases of difficulty, as when two pieces of comb met at an angle,\\nhow often the bees would entirely pull down and rebuild in different\\nways the same cell, sometimes recurring to a shape which they had at\\nfirst rejected.', 'When bees have a place on which they can stand in their proper positions\\nfor working,--for instance, on a slip of wood, placed directly under the\\nmiddle of a comb growing downwards so that the comb has to be built over\\none face of the slip--in this case the bees can lay the foundations\\nof one wall of a new hexagon, in its strictly proper place, projecting\\nbeyond the other completed cells.', 'It suffices that the bees should be\\nenabled to stand at their proper relative distances from each other\\nand from the walls of the last completed cells, and then, by striking\\nimaginary spheres, they can build up a wall intermediate between two\\nadjoining spheres; but, as far as I have seen, they never gnaw away and\\nfinish off the angles of a cell till a large part both of that cell and\\nof the adjoining cells has been built.', 'This capacity in bees of laying\\ndown under certain circumstances a rough wall in its proper place\\nbetween two just-commenced cells, is important, as it bears on a fact,\\nwhich seems at first quite subversive of the foregoing theory; namely,\\nthat the cells on the extreme margin of wasp-combs are sometimes\\nstrictly hexagonal; but I have not space here to enter on this subject.', 'Nor does there seem to me any great difficulty in a single insect (as\\nin the case of a queen-wasp) making hexagonal cells, if she work\\nalternately on the inside and outside of two or three cells commenced at\\nthe same time, always standing at the proper relative distance from\\nthe parts of the cells just begun, sweeping spheres or cylinders, and\\nbuilding up intermediate planes.', 'It is even conceivable that an insect\\nmight, by fixing on a point at which to commence a cell, and then moving\\noutside, first to one point, and then to five other points, at the\\nproper relative distances from the central point and from each other,\\nstrike the planes of intersection, and so make an isolated hexagon: but\\nI am not aware that any such case has been observed; nor would any good\\nbe derived from a single hexagon being built, as in its construction\\nmore materials would be required than for a cylinder.', 'As natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slight\\nmodifications of structure or instinct, each profitable to the\\nindividual under its conditions of life, it may reasonably be asked, how\\na long and graduated succession of modified architectural instincts,\\nall tending towards the present perfect plan of construction, could\\nhave profited the progenitors of the hive-bee?', 'I think the answer is\\nnot difficult: it is known that bees are often hard pressed to get\\nsufficient nectar; and I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier that it has been\\nexperimentally found that no less than from twelve to fifteen pounds of\\ndry sugar are consumed by a hive of bees for the secretion of each pound\\nof wax; so that a prodigious quantity of fluid nectar must be collected\\nand consumed by the bees in a hive for the secretion of the wax\\nnecessary for the construction of their combs.', 'Moreover, many bees have\\nto remain idle for many days during the process of secretion.', 'A large\\nstore of honey is indispensable to support a large stock of bees during\\nthe winter; and the security of the hive is known mainly to depend on a\\nlarge number of bees being supported.', 'Hence the saving of wax by largely\\nsaving honey must be a most important element of success in any family\\nof bees.', 'Of course the success of any species of bee may be dependent\\non the number of its parasites or other enemies, or on quite distinct\\ncauses, and so be altogether independent of the quantity of honey which\\nthe bees could collect.', 'But let us suppose that this latter circumstance\\ndetermined, as it probably often does determine, the numbers of a\\nhumble-bee which could exist in a country; and let us further suppose\\nthat the community lived throughout the winter, and consequently\\nrequired a store of honey: there can in this case be no doubt that it\\nwould be an advantage to our humble-bee, if a slight modification of\\nher instinct led her to make her waxen cells near together, so as to\\nintersect a little; for a wall in common even to two adjoining cells,\\nwould save some little wax.', 'Hence it would continually be more and more\\nadvantageous to our humble-bee, if she were to make her cells more and\\nmore regular, nearer together, and aggregated into a mass, like the\\ncells of the Melipona; for in this case a large part of the bounding\\nsurface of each cell would serve to bound other cells, and much wax\\nwould be saved.', 'Again, from the same cause, it would be advantageous to\\nthe Melipona, if she were to make her cells closer together, and more\\nregular in every way than at present; for then, as we have seen, the\\nspherical surfaces would wholly disappear, and would all be replaced by\\nplane surfaces; and the Melipona would make a comb as perfect as that of\\nthe hive-bee.', 'Beyond this stage of perfection in architecture, natural\\nselection could not lead; for the comb of the hive-bee, as far as we can\\nsee, is absolutely perfect in economising wax.', 'Thus, as I believe, the most wonderful of all known instincts, that\\nof the hive-bee, can be explained by natural selection having taken\\nadvantage of numerous, successive, slight modifications of simpler\\ninstincts; natural selection having by slow degrees, more and more\\nperfectly, led the bees to sweep equal spheres at a given distance from\\neach other in a double layer, and to build up and excavate the wax along\\nthe planes of intersection.', 'The bees, of course, no more knowing that\\nthey swept their spheres at one particular distance from each other,\\nthan they know what are the several angles of the hexagonal prisms and\\nof the basal rhombic plates.', 'The motive power of the process of natural\\nselection having been economy of wax; that individual swarm which wasted\\nleast honey in the secretion of wax, having succeeded best, and having\\ntransmitted by inheritance its newly acquired economical instinct to new\\nswarms, which in their turn will have had the best chance of succeeding\\nin the struggle for existence.', 'No doubt many instincts of very difficult explanation could be opposed\\nto the theory of natural selection,--cases, in which we cannot see\\nhow an instinct could possibly have originated; cases, in which no\\nintermediate gradations are known to exist; cases of instinct of\\napparently such trifling importance, that they could hardly have been\\nacted on by natural selection; cases of instincts almost identically the\\nsame in animals so remote in the scale of nature, that we cannot account\\nfor their similarity by inheritance from a common parent, and must\\ntherefore believe that they have been acquired by independent acts of\\nnatural selection.', 'I will not here enter on these several cases, but\\nwill confine myself to one special difficulty, which at first appeared\\nto me insuperable, and actually fatal to my whole theory.', 'I allude to\\nthe neuters or sterile females in insect-communities: for these neuters\\noften differ widely in instinct and in structure from both the males\\nand fertile females, and yet, from being sterile, they cannot propagate\\ntheir kind.', 'The subject well deserves to be discussed at great length, but I will\\nhere take only a single case, that of working or sterile ants.', 'How the\\nworkers have been rendered sterile is a difficulty; but not much greater\\nthan that of any other striking modification of structure; for it can\\nbe shown that some insects and other articulate animals in a state of\\nnature occasionally become sterile; and if such insects had been social,\\nand it had been profitable to the community that a number should have\\nbeen annually born capable of work, but incapable of procreation, I\\ncan see no very great difficulty in this being effected by natural\\nselection.', 'But I must pass over this preliminary difficulty.', 'The great\\ndifficulty lies in the working ants differing widely from both the males\\nand the fertile females in structure, as in the shape of the thorax and\\nin being destitute of wings and sometimes of eyes, and in instinct.', 'As\\nfar as instinct alone is concerned, the prodigious difference in this\\nrespect between the workers and the perfect females, would have been\\nfar better exemplified by the hive-bee.', 'If a working ant or other\\nneuter insect had been an animal in the ordinary state, I should have\\nunhesitatingly assumed that all its characters had been slowly acquired\\nthrough natural selection; namely, by an individual having been born\\nwith some slight profitable modification of structure, this being\\ninherited by its offspring, which again varied and were again selected,\\nand so onwards.', 'But with the working ant we have an insect differing\\ngreatly from its parents, yet absolutely sterile; so that it could never\\nhave transmitted successively acquired modifications of structure or\\ninstinct to its progeny.', 'It may well be asked how is it possible to\\nreconcile this case with the theory of natural selection?', 'First, let it be remembered that we have innumerable instances, both in\\nour domestic productions and in those in a state of nature, of all sorts\\nof differences of structure which have become correlated to certain\\nages, and to either sex.', 'We have differences correlated not only to\\none sex, but to that short period alone when the reproductive system is\\nactive, as in the nuptial plumage of many birds, and in the hooked jaws\\nof the male salmon.', 'We have even slight differences in the horns of\\ndifferent breeds of cattle in relation to an artificially imperfect\\nstate of the male sex; for oxen of certain breeds have longer horns than\\nin other breeds, in comparison with the horns of the bulls or cows of\\nthese same breeds.', 'Hence I can see no real difficulty in any character\\nhaving become correlated with the sterile condition of certain members\\nof insect-communities: the difficulty lies in understanding how such\\ncorrelated modifications of structure could have been slowly accumulated\\nby natural selection.', 'This difficulty, though appearing insuperable, is lessened, or, as I\\nbelieve, disappears, when it is remembered that selection may be applied\\nto the family, as well as to the individual, and may thus gain the\\ndesired end.', 'Thus, a well-flavoured vegetable is cooked, and the\\nindividual is destroyed; but the horticulturist sows seeds of the same\\nstock, and confidently expects to get nearly the same variety; breeders\\nof cattle wish the flesh and fat to be well marbled together; the animal\\nhas been slaughtered, but the breeder goes with confidence to the same\\nfamily.', 'I have such faith in the powers of selection, that I do not\\ndoubt that a breed of cattle, always yielding oxen with extraordinarily\\nlong horns, could be slowly formed by carefully watching which\\nindividual bulls and cows, when matched, produced oxen with the longest\\nhorns; and yet no one ox could ever have propagated its kind.', 'Thus\\nI believe it has been with social insects: a slight modification of\\nstructure, or instinct, correlated with the sterile condition of certain\\nmembers of the community, has been advantageous to the community:\\nconsequently the fertile males and females of the same community\\nflourished, and transmitted to their fertile offspring a tendency to\\nproduce sterile members having the same modification.', 'And I believe\\nthat this process has been repeated, until that prodigious amount of\\ndifference between the fertile and sterile females of the same species\\nhas been produced, which we see in many social insects.', 'But we have not as yet touched on the climax of the difficulty; namely,\\nthe fact that the neuters of several ants differ, not only from the\\nfertile females and males, but from each other, sometimes to an almost\\nincredible degree, and are thus divided into two or even three castes.', 'The castes, moreover, do not generally graduate into each other, but are\\nperfectly well defined; being as distinct from each other, as are any\\ntwo species of the same genus, or rather as any two genera of the same\\nfamily.', 'Thus in Eciton, there are working and soldier neuters, with jaws\\nand instincts extraordinarily different: in Cryptocerus, the workers of\\none caste alone carry a wonderful sort of shield on their heads, the use\\nof which is quite unknown: in the Mexican Myrmecocystus, the workers of\\none caste never leave the nest; they are fed by the workers of another\\ncaste, and they have an enormously developed abdomen which secretes a\\nsort of honey, supplying the place of that excreted by the aphides, or\\nthe domestic cattle as they may be called, which our European ants guard\\nor imprison.', 'It will indeed be thought that I have an overweening confidence in the\\nprinciple of natural selection, when I do not admit that such wonderful\\nand well-established facts at once annihilate my theory.', 'In the simpler\\ncase of neuter insects all of one caste or of the same kind, which have\\nbeen rendered by natural selection, as I believe to be quite possible,\\ndifferent from the fertile males and females,--in this case, we may\\nsafely conclude from the analogy of ordinary variations, that each\\nsuccessive, slight, profitable modification did not probably at first\\nappear in all the individual neuters in the same nest, but in a few\\nalone; and that by the long-continued selection of the fertile parents\\nwhich produced most neuters with the profitable modification, all the\\nneuters ultimately came to have the desired character.', 'On this view we\\nought occasionally to find neuter-insects of the same species, in the\\nsame nest, presenting gradations of structure; and this we do find,\\neven often, considering how few neuter-insects out of Europe have been\\ncarefully examined.', 'Mr. F. Smith has shown how surprisingly the neuters\\nof several British ants differ from each other in size and sometimes\\nin colour; and that the extreme forms can sometimes be perfectly linked\\ntogether by individuals taken out of the same nest: I have myself\\ncompared perfect gradations of this kind.', 'It often happens that the\\nlarger or the smaller sized workers are the most numerous; or that both\\nlarge and small are numerous, with those of an intermediate size scanty\\nin numbers.', 'Formica flava has larger and smaller workers, with some of\\nintermediate size; and, in this species, as Mr. F. Smith has observed,\\nthe larger workers have simple eyes (ocelli), which though small can\\nbe plainly distinguished, whereas the smaller workers have their ocelli\\nrudimentary.', 'Having carefully dissected several specimens of these\\nworkers, I can affirm that the eyes are far more rudimentary in the\\nsmaller workers than can be accounted for merely by their proportionally\\nlesser size; and I fully believe, though I dare not assert so\\npositively, that the workers of intermediate size have their ocelli in\\nan exactly intermediate condition.', 'So that we here have two bodies of\\nsterile workers in the same nest, differing not only in size, but\\nin their organs of vision, yet connected by some few members in an\\nintermediate condition.', 'I may digress by adding, that if the smaller\\nworkers had been the most useful to the community, and those males and\\nfemales had been continually selected, which produced more and more\\nof the smaller workers, until all the workers had come to be in this\\ncondition; we should then have had a species of ant with neuters very\\nnearly in the same condition with those of Myrmica.', 'For the workers of\\nMyrmica have not even rudiments of ocelli, though the male and female\\nants of this genus have well-developed ocelli.', \"I may give one other case: so confidently did I expect to find\\ngradations in important points of structure between the different castes\\nof neuters in the same species, that I gladly availed myself of Mr. F.\\nSmith's offer of numerous specimens from the same nest of the driver\\nant (Anomma) of West Africa.\", 'The reader will perhaps best appreciate\\nthe amount of difference in these workers, by my giving not the actual\\nmeasurements, but a strictly accurate illustration: the difference was\\nthe same as if we were to see a set of workmen building a house of whom\\nmany were five feet four inches high, and many sixteen feet high; but\\nwe must suppose that the larger workmen had heads four instead of three\\ntimes as big as those of the smaller men, and jaws nearly five times\\nas big.', 'The jaws, moreover, of the working ants of the several sizes\\ndiffered wonderfully in shape, and in the form and number of the teeth.', 'But the important fact for us is, that though the workers can be grouped\\ninto castes of different sizes, yet they graduate insensibly into each\\nother, as does the widely-different structure of their jaws.', 'I speak\\nconfidently on this latter point, as Mr. Lubbock made drawings for\\nme with the camera lucida of the jaws which I had dissected from the\\nworkers of the several sizes.', 'With these facts before me, I believe that natural selection, by acting\\non the fertile parents, could form a species which should regularly\\nproduce neuters, either all of large size with one form of jaw, or all\\nof small size with jaws having a widely different structure; or lastly,\\nand this is our climax of difficulty, one set of workers of one size and\\nstructure, and simultaneously another set of workers of a different size\\nand structure;--a graduated series having been first formed, as in the\\ncase of the driver ant, and then the extreme forms, from being the most\\nuseful to the community, having been produced in greater and greater\\nnumbers through the natural selection of the parents which generated\\nthem; until none with an intermediate structure were produced.', 'Thus, as I believe, the wonderful fact of two distinctly defined castes\\nof sterile workers existing in the same nest, both widely different from\\neach other and from their parents, has originated.', 'We can see how useful\\ntheir production may have been to a social community of insects, on the\\nsame principle that the division of labour is useful to civilised man.', 'As ants work by inherited instincts and by inherited tools or weapons,\\nand not by acquired knowledge and manufactured instruments, a perfect\\ndivision of labour could be effected with them only by the workers being\\nsterile; for had they been fertile, they would have intercrossed, and\\ntheir instincts and structure would have become blended.', 'And nature\\nhas, as I believe, effected this admirable division of labour in the\\ncommunities of ants, by the means of natural selection.', 'But I am bound\\nto confess, that, with all my faith in this principle, I should never\\nhave anticipated that natural selection could have been efficient in so\\nhigh a degree, had not the case of these neuter insects convinced me\\nof the fact.', 'I have, therefore, discussed this case, at some little\\nbut wholly insufficient length, in order to show the power of natural\\nselection, and likewise because this is by far the most serious special\\ndifficulty, which my theory has encountered.', 'The case, also, is very\\ninteresting, as it proves that with animals, as with plants, any amount\\nof modification in structure can be effected by the accumulation of\\nnumerous, slight, and as we must call them accidental, variations, which\\nare in any manner profitable, without exercise or habit having come into\\nplay.', 'For no amount of exercise, or habit, or volition, in the utterly\\nsterile members of a community could possibly have affected the\\nstructure or instincts of the fertile members, which alone leave\\ndescendants.', 'I am surprised that no one has advanced this demonstrative\\ncase of neuter insects, against the well-known doctrine of Lamarck.', 'SUMMARY.', 'I have endeavoured briefly in this chapter to show that the mental\\nqualities of our domestic animals vary, and that the variations are\\ninherited.', 'Still more briefly I have attempted to show that instincts\\nvary slightly in a state of nature.', 'No one will dispute that instincts\\nare of the highest importance to each animal.', 'Therefore I can see no\\ndifficulty, under changing conditions of life, in natural selection\\naccumulating slight modifications of instinct to any extent, in any\\nuseful direction.', 'In some cases habit or use and disuse have probably\\ncome into play.', 'I do not pretend that the facts given in this chapter\\nstrengthen in any great degree my theory; but none of the cases of\\ndifficulty, to the best of my judgment, annihilate it.', 'On the other\\nhand, the fact that instincts are not always absolutely perfect and\\nare liable to mistakes;--that no instinct has been produced for the\\nexclusive good of other animals, but that each animal takes advantage of\\nthe instincts of others;--that the canon in natural history, of \"natura\\nnon facit saltum\" is applicable to instincts as well as to corporeal\\nstructure, and is plainly explicable on the foregoing views, but is\\notherwise inexplicable,--all tend to corroborate the theory of natural\\nselection.', 'This theory is, also, strengthened by some few other facts in regard\\nto instincts; as by that common case of closely allied, but certainly\\ndistinct, species, when inhabiting distant parts of the world and living\\nunder considerably different conditions of life, yet often retaining\\nnearly the same instincts.', 'For instance, we can understand on the\\nprinciple of inheritance, how it is that the thrush of South America\\nlines its nest with mud, in the same peculiar manner as does our British\\nthrush: how it is that the male wrens (Troglodytes) of North America,\\nbuild \"cock-nests,\" to roost in, like the males of our distinct\\nKitty-wrens,--a habit wholly unlike that of any other known bird.', 'Finally, it may not be a logical deduction, but to my imagination it\\nis far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo\\nejecting its foster-brothers,--ants making slaves,--the larvae of\\nichneumonidae feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars,--not as\\nspecially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one\\ngeneral law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely,\\nmultiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.', '8.', 'HYBRIDISM.', 'Distinction between the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids.', 'Sterility various in degree, not universal, affected by close\\ninterbreeding, removed by domestication.', 'Laws governing the sterility\\nof hybrids.', 'Sterility not a special endowment, but incidental on other\\ndifferences.', 'Causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids.', 'Parallelism between the effects of changed conditions of life and\\ncrossing.', 'Fertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongrel\\noffspring not universal.', 'Hybrids and mongrels compared independently of\\ntheir fertility.', 'Summary.', 'The view generally entertained by naturalists is that species, when\\nintercrossed, have been specially endowed with the quality of sterility,\\nin order to prevent the confusion of all organic forms.', 'This view\\ncertainly seems at first probable, for species within the same country\\ncould hardly have kept distinct had they been capable of crossing\\nfreely.', 'The importance of the fact that hybrids are very generally\\nsterile, has, I think, been much underrated by some late writers.', 'On the\\ntheory of natural selection the case is especially important, inasmuch\\nas the sterility of hybrids could not possibly be of any advantage\\nto them, and therefore could not have been acquired by the continued\\npreservation of successive profitable degrees of sterility.', 'I hope,\\nhowever, to be able to show that sterility is not a specially acquired\\nor endowed quality, but is incidental on other acquired differences.', 'In treating this subject, two classes of facts, to a large extent\\nfundamentally different, have generally been confounded together;\\nnamely, the sterility of two species when first crossed, and the\\nsterility of the hybrids produced from them.', 'Pure species have of course their organs of reproduction in a perfect\\ncondition, yet when intercrossed they produce either few or no\\noffspring.', 'Hybrids, on the other hand, have their reproductive organs\\nfunctionally impotent, as may be clearly seen in the state of the male\\nelement in both plants and animals;

for it seems to make a broad\\nand clear distinction between varieties and species.', 'First, for the sterility of species when crossed and of their hybrid\\noffspring.', 'It is impossible to study the several memoirs and works of\\nthose two conscientious and admirable observers, Kolreuter and Gartner,\\nwho almost devoted their lives to this subject, without being deeply\\nimpressed with the high generality of some degree of sterility.', 'Kolreuter makes the rule universal; but then he cuts the knot, for in\\nten cases in which he found two forms, considered by most authors as\\ndistinct species, quite fertile together, he unhesitatingly ranks them\\nas varieties.', \"Gartner, also, makes the rule equally universal; and he\\ndisputes the entire fertility of Kolreuter's ten cases.\", 'But in these and\\nin many other cases, Gartner is obliged carefully to count the seeds, in\\norder to show that there is any degree of sterility.', 'He always compares\\nthe maximum number of seeds produced by two species when crossed and by\\ntheir hybrid offspring, with the average number produced by both pure\\nparent-species in a state of nature.', 'But a serious cause of error seems\\nto me to be here introduced: a plant to be hybridised must be castrated,\\nand, what is often more important, must be secluded in order to prevent\\npollen being brought to it by insects from other plants.', 'Nearly all the\\nplants experimentised on by Gartner were potted, and apparently were\\nkept in a chamber in his house.', 'That these processes are often injurious\\nto the fertility of a plant cannot be doubted; for Gartner gives in\\nhis table about a score of cases of plants which he castrated, and\\nartificially fertilised with their own pollen, and (excluding all cases\\nsuch as the Leguminosae, in which there is an acknowledged difficulty\\nin the manipulation) half of these twenty plants had their fertility\\nin some degree impaired.', 'Moreover, as Gartner during several years\\nrepeatedly crossed the primrose and cowslip, which we have such good\\nreason to believe to be varieties, and only once or twice succeeded in\\ngetting fertile seed; as he found the common red and blue pimpernels\\n(Anagallis arvensis and coerulea), which the best botanists rank as\\nvarieties, absolutely sterile together; and as he came to the same\\nconclusion in several other analogous cases; it seems to me that we\\nmay well be permitted to doubt whether many other species are really so\\nsterile, when intercrossed, as Gartner believes.', 'It is certain, on the one hand, that the sterility of various species\\nwhen crossed is so different in degree and graduates away so insensibly,\\nand, on the other hand, that the fertility of pure species is so easily\\naffected by various circumstances, that for all practical purposes it is\\nmost difficult to say where perfect fertility ends and sterility begins.', 'I think no better evidence of this can be required than that the two\\nmost experienced observers who have ever lived, namely, Kolreuter and\\nGartner, should have arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions\\nin regard to the very same species.', 'It is also most instructive to\\ncompare--but I have not space here to enter on details--the evidence\\nadvanced by our best botanists on the question whether certain doubtful\\nforms should be ranked as species or varieties, with the evidence from\\nfertility adduced by different hybridisers, or by the same author,\\nfrom experiments made during different years.', 'It can thus be shown that\\nneither sterility nor fertility affords any clear distinction between\\nspecies and varieties; but that the evidence from this source graduates\\naway, and is doubtful in the same degree as is the evidence derived from\\nother constitutional and structural differences.', 'In regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations; though\\nGartner was enabled to rear some hybrids, carefully guarding them from a\\ncross with either pure parent, for six or seven, and in one case for\\nten generations, yet he asserts positively that their fertility never\\nincreased, but generally greatly decreased.', 'I do not doubt that this is\\nusually the case, and that the fertility often suddenly decreases in\\nthe first few generations.', 'Nevertheless I believe that in all these\\nexperiments the fertility has been diminished by an independent cause,\\nnamely, from close interbreeding.', 'I have collected so large a body of\\nfacts, showing that close interbreeding lessens fertility, and, on\\nthe other hand, that an occasional cross with a distinct individual or\\nvariety increases fertility, that I cannot doubt the correctness of this\\nalmost universal belief amongst breeders.', 'Hybrids are seldom raised by\\nexperimentalists in great numbers; and as the parent-species, or other\\nallied hybrids, generally grow in the same garden, the visits of insects\\nmust be carefully prevented during the flowering season: hence hybrids\\nwill generally be fertilised during each generation by their own\\nindividual pollen; and I am convinced that this would be injurious\\nto their fertility, already lessened by their hybrid origin.', 'I am\\nstrengthened in this conviction by a remarkable statement repeatedly\\nmade by Gartner, namely, that if even the less fertile hybrids be\\nartificially fertilised with hybrid pollen of the same kind, their\\nfertility, notwithstanding the frequent ill effects of manipulation,\\nsometimes decidedly increases, and goes on increasing.', 'Now, in\\nartificial fertilisation pollen is as often taken by chance (as I know\\nfrom my own experience) from the anthers of another flower, as from the\\nanthers of the flower itself which is to be fertilised; so that a cross\\nbetween two flowers, though probably on the same plant, would be thus\\neffected.', 'Moreover, whenever complicated experiments are in progress,\\nso careful an observer as Gartner would have castrated his hybrids, and\\nthis would have insured in each generation a cross with the pollen from\\na distinct flower, either from the same plant or from another plant of\\nthe same hybrid nature.', 'And thus, the strange fact of the increase\\nof fertility in the successive generations of ARTIFICIALLY FERTILISED\\nhybrids may, I believe, be accounted for by close interbreeding having\\nbeen avoided.', 'Now let us turn to the results arrived at by the third most experienced\\nhybridiser, namely, the Honourable and Reverend W. Herbert.', 'He is as\\nemphatic in his conclusion that some hybrids are perfectly fertile--as\\nfertile as the pure parent-species--as are Kolreuter and Gartner that\\nsome degree of sterility between distinct species is a universal law\\nof nature.', 'He experimentised on some of the very same species as did\\nGartner.', \"The difference in their results may, I think, be in part\\naccounted for by Herbert's great horticultural skill, and by his having\\nhothouses at his command.\", 'Of his many important statements I will here\\ngive only a single one as an example, namely, that \"every ovule in a pod\\nof Crinum capense fertilised by C. revolutum produced a plant, which\\n(he says) I never saw to occur in a case of its natural fecundation.\"', 'So\\nthat we here have perfect, or even more than commonly perfect, fertility\\nin a first cross between two distinct species.', 'This case of the Crinum leads me to refer to a most singular fact,\\nnamely, that there are individual plants, as with certain species of\\nLobelia, and with all the species of the genus Hippeastrum, which can\\nbe far more easily fertilised by the pollen of another and distinct\\nspecies, than by their own pollen.', 'For these plants have been found to\\nyield seed to the pollen of a distinct species, though quite sterile\\nwith their own pollen, notwithstanding that their own pollen was found\\nto be perfectly good, for it fertilised distinct species.', 'So that\\ncertain individual plants and all the individuals of certain species\\ncan actually be hybridised much more readily than they can be\\nself-fertilised!', 'For instance, a bulb of Hippeastrum aulicum produced\\nfour flowers; three were fertilised by Herbert with their own pollen,\\nand the fourth was subsequently fertilised by the pollen of a compound\\nhybrid descended from three other and distinct species: the result was\\nthat \"the ovaries of the three first flowers soon ceased to grow, and\\nafter a few days perished entirely, whereas the pod impregnated by\\nthe pollen of the hybrid made vigorous growth and rapid progress to\\nmaturity, and bore good seed, which vegetated freely.\"', 'In a letter to\\nme, in 1839, Mr. Herbert told me that he had then tried the experiment\\nduring five years, and he continued to try it during several subsequent\\nyears, and always with the same result.', 'This result has, also, been\\nconfirmed by other observers in the case of Hippeastrum with its\\nsub-genera, and in the case of some other genera, as Lobelia, Passiflora\\nand Verbascum.', 'Although the plants in these experiments appeared\\nperfectly healthy, and although both the ovules and pollen of the same\\nflower were perfectly good with respect to other species, yet as they\\nwere functionally imperfect in their mutual self-action, we must infer\\nthat the plants were in an unnatural state.', 'Nevertheless these facts\\nshow on what slight and mysterious causes the lesser or greater\\nfertility of species when crossed, in comparison with the same species\\nwhen self-fertilised, sometimes depends.', 'The practical experiments of horticulturists, though not made with\\nscientific precision, deserve some notice.', 'It is notorious in how\\ncomplicated a manner the species of Pelargonium, Fuchsia, Calceolaria,\\nPetunia, Rhododendron, etc., have been crossed, yet many of these\\nhybrids seed freely.', 'For instance, Herbert asserts that a hybrid from\\nCalceolaria integrifolia and plantaginea, species most widely dissimilar\\nin general habit, \"reproduced itself as perfectly as if it had been a\\nnatural species from the mountains of Chile.\"', 'I have taken some pains\\nto ascertain the degree of fertility of some of the complex crosses of\\nRhododendrons, and I am assured that many of them are perfectly fertile.', 'Mr. C. Noble, for instance, informs me that he raises stocks for\\ngrafting from a hybrid between Rhododendron Ponticum and Catawbiense,\\nand that this hybrid \"seeds as freely as it is possible to imagine.\"', 'Had\\nhybrids, when fairly treated, gone on decreasing in fertility in each\\nsuccessive generation, as Gartner believes to be the case, the fact\\nwould have been notorious to nurserymen.', 'Horticulturists raise large\\nbeds of the same hybrids, and such alone are fairly treated, for by\\ninsect agency the several individuals of the same hybrid variety are\\nallowed to freely cross with each other, and the injurious influence\\nof close interbreeding is thus prevented.', 'Any one may readily convince\\nhimself of the efficiency of insect-agency by examining the flowers of\\nthe more sterile kinds of hybrid rhododendrons, which produce no pollen,\\nfor he will find on their stigmas plenty of pollen brought from other\\nflowers.', 'In regard to animals, much fewer experiments have been carefully tried\\nthan with plants.', 'If our systematic arrangements can be trusted, that\\nis if the genera of animals are as distinct from each other, as are the\\ngenera of plants, then we may infer that animals more widely separated\\nin the scale of nature can be more easily crossed than in the case of\\nplants; but the hybrids themselves are, I think, more sterile.', 'I doubt\\nwhether any case of a perfectly fertile hybrid animal can be considered\\nas thoroughly well authenticated.', 'It should, however, be borne in\\nmind that, owing to few animals breeding freely under confinement, few\\nexperiments have been fairly tried: for instance, the canary-bird has\\nbeen crossed with nine other finches, but as not one of these nine\\nspecies breeds freely in confinement, we have no right to expect that\\nthe first crosses between them and the canary, or that their hybrids,\\nshould be perfectly fertile.', 'Again, with respect to the fertility in\\nsuccessive generations of the more fertile hybrid animals, I hardly know\\nof an instance in which two families of the same hybrid have been raised\\nat the same time from different parents, so as to avoid the ill effects\\nof close interbreeding.', 'On the contrary, brothers and sisters have\\nusually been crossed in each successive generation, in opposition to the\\nconstantly repeated admonition of every breeder.', 'And in this case, it is\\nnot at all surprising that the inherent sterility in the hybrids should\\nhave gone on increasing.', 'If we were to act thus, and pair brothers and\\nsisters in the case of any pure animal, which from any cause had the\\nleast tendency to sterility, the breed would assuredly be lost in a very\\nfew generations.', 'Although I do not know of any thoroughly well-authenticated cases of\\nperfectly fertile hybrid animals, I have some reason to believe that\\nthe hybrids from Cervulus vaginalis and Reevesii, and from Phasianus\\ncolchicus with P. torquatus and with P. versicolor are perfectly\\nfertile.', 'The hybrids from the common and Chinese geese (A. cygnoides),\\nspecies which are so different that they are generally ranked in\\ndistinct genera, have often bred in this country with either pure\\nparent, and in one single instance they have bred inter se.', 'This was\\neffected by Mr. Eyton, who raised two hybrids from the same parents but\\nfrom different hatches; and from these two birds he raised no less than\\neight hybrids (grandchildren of the pure geese) from one nest.', 'In India,\\nhowever, these cross-bred geese must be far more fertile; for I am\\nassured by two eminently capable judges, namely Mr. Blyth and Capt.', 'Hutton, that whole flocks of these crossed geese are kept in various\\nparts of the country; and as they are kept for profit, where neither\\npure parent-species exists, they must certainly be highly fertile.', 'A doctrine which originated with Pallas, has been largely accepted\\nby modern naturalists; namely, that most of our domestic animals have\\ndescended from two or more aboriginal species, since commingled by\\nintercrossing.', 'On this view, the aboriginal species must either at first\\nhave produced quite fertile hybrids, or the hybrids must have become in\\nsubsequent generations quite fertile under domestication.', 'This latter\\nalternative seems to me the most probable, and I am inclined to believe\\nin its truth, although it rests on no direct evidence.', 'I believe, for\\ninstance, that our dogs have descended from several wild stocks; yet,\\nwith perhaps the exception of certain indigenous domestic dogs of South\\nAmerica, all are quite fertile together; and analogy makes me greatly\\ndoubt, whether the several aboriginal species would at first have freely\\nbred together and have produced quite fertile hybrids.', 'So again there\\nis reason to believe that our European and the humped Indian cattle are\\nquite fertile together; but from facts communicated to me by Mr. Blyth,\\nI think they must be considered as distinct species.', 'On this view of\\nthe origin of many of our domestic animals, we must either give up the\\nbelief of the almost universal sterility of distinct species of\\nanimals when crossed; or we must look at sterility, not as an indelible\\ncharacteristic, but as one capable of being removed by domestication.', 'Finally, looking to all the ascertained facts on the intercrossing of\\nplants and animals, it may be concluded that some degree of sterility,\\nboth in first crosses and in hybrids, is an extremely general result;\\nbut that it cannot, under our present state of knowledge, be considered\\nas absolutely universal.', 'LAWS GOVERNING THE STERILITY OF FIRST CROSSES AND OF HYBRIDS.', 'We will now consider a little more in detail the circumstances and\\nrules governing the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids.', 'Our chief\\nobject will be to see whether or not the rules indicate that species\\nhave specially been endowed with this quality, in order to prevent their\\ncrossing and blending together in utter confusion.', \"The following rules\\nand conclusions are chiefly drawn up from Gartner's admirable work on\\nthe hybridisation of plants.\", 'I have taken much pains to ascertain how\\nfar the rules apply to animals, and considering how scanty our knowledge\\nis in regard to hybrid animals, I have been surprised to find how\\ngenerally the same rules apply to both kingdoms.', 'It has been already remarked, that the degree of fertility, both of\\nfirst crosses and of hybrids, graduates from zero to perfect fertility.', 'It is surprising in how many curious ways this gradation can be shown to\\nexist; but only the barest outline of the facts can here be given.', 'When\\npollen from a plant of one family is placed on the stigma of a plant of\\na distinct family, it exerts no more influence than so much inorganic\\ndust.', \"From this absolute zero of fertility, the pollen of different\\nspecies of the same genus applied to the stigma of some one species,\\nyields a perfect gradation in the number of seeds produced, up to nearly\\ncomplete or even quite complete fertility; and, as we have seen, in\\ncertain abnormal cases, even to an excess of fertility, beyond that\\nwhich the plant's own pollen will produce.\", 'So in hybrids themselves,\\nthere are some which never have produced, and probably never would\\nproduce, even with the pollen of either pure parent, a single fertile\\nseed: but in some of these cases a first trace of fertility may be\\ndetected, by the pollen of one of the pure parent-species causing the\\nflower of the hybrid to wither earlier than it otherwise would have\\ndone; and the early withering of the flower is well known to be a sign\\nof incipient fertilisation.', 'From this extreme degree of sterility we\\nhave self-fertilised hybrids producing a greater and greater number of\\nseeds up to perfect fertility.', 'Hybrids from two species which are very difficult to cross, and which\\nrarely produce any offspring, are generally very sterile; but the\\nparallelism between the difficulty of making a first cross, and the\\nsterility of the hybrids thus produced--two classes of facts which are\\ngenerally confounded together--is by no means strict.', 'There are many\\ncases, in which two pure species can be united with unusual facility,\\nand produce numerous hybrid-offspring, yet these hybrids are remarkably\\nsterile.', 'On the other hand, there are species which can be crossed\\nvery rarely, or with extreme difficulty, but the hybrids, when at last\\nproduced, are very fertile.', 'Even within the limits of the same genus,\\nfor instance in Dianthus, these two opposite cases occur.', 'The fertility, both of first crosses and of hybrids, is more easily\\naffected by unfavourable conditions, than is the fertility of pure\\nspecies.', 'But the degree of fertility is likewise innately variable; for\\nit is not always the same when the same two species are crossed under\\nthe same circumstances, but depends in part upon the constitution of the\\nindividuals which happen to have been chosen for the experiment.', 'So it\\nis with hybrids, for their degree of fertility is often found to differ\\ngreatly in the several individuals raised from seed out of the same\\ncapsule and exposed to exactly the same conditions.', 'By the term systematic affinity is meant, the resemblance between\\nspecies in structure and in constitution, more especially in the\\nstructure of parts which are of high physiological importance and which\\ndiffer little in the allied species.', 'Now the fertility of first crosses\\nbetween species, and of the hybrids produced from them, is largely\\ngoverned by their systematic affinity.', 'This is clearly shown by hybrids\\nnever having been raised between species ranked by systematists in\\ndistinct families; and on the other hand, by very closely allied\\nspecies generally uniting with facility.', 'But the correspondence between\\nsystematic affinity and the facility of crossing is by no means strict.', 'A multitude of cases could be given of very closely allied species which\\nwill not unite, or only with extreme difficulty; and on the other hand\\nof very distinct species which unite with the utmost facility.', 'In\\nthe same family there may be a genus, as Dianthus, in which very many\\nspecies can most readily be crossed; and another genus, as Silene,\\nin which the most persevering efforts have failed to produce between\\nextremely close species a single hybrid.', 'Even within the limits of the\\nsame genus, we meet with this same difference; for instance, the many\\nspecies of Nicotiana have been more largely crossed than the species of\\nalmost any other genus; but Gartner found that N. acuminata, which is\\nnot a particularly distinct species, obstinately failed to fertilise, or\\nto be fertilised by, no less than eight other species of Nicotiana.', 'Very\\nmany analogous facts could be given.', 'No one has been able to point out what kind, or what amount, of\\ndifference in any recognisable character is sufficient to prevent two\\nspecies crossing.', 'It can be shown that plants most widely different in\\nhabit and general appearance, and having strongly marked differences in\\nevery part of the flower, even in the pollen, in the fruit, and in the\\ncotyledons, can be crossed.', 'Annual and perennial plants, deciduous and\\nevergreen trees, plants inhabiting different stations and fitted for\\nextremely different climates, can often be crossed with ease.', 'By a reciprocal cross between two species, I mean the case, for\\ninstance, of a stallion-horse being first crossed with a female-ass, and\\nthen a male-ass with a mare: these two species may then be said to have\\nbeen reciprocally crossed.', 'There is often the widest possible difference\\nin the facility of making reciprocal crosses.', 'Such cases are highly\\nimportant, for they prove that the capacity in any two species to cross\\nis often completely independent of their systematic affinity, or of any\\nrecognisable difference in their whole organisation.', 'On the other hand,\\nthese cases clearly show that the capacity for crossing is connected\\nwith constitutional differences imperceptible by us, and confined to the\\nreproductive system.', 'This difference in the result of reciprocal crosses\\nbetween the same two species was long ago observed by Kolreuter.', 'To give\\nan instance: Mirabilis jalappa can easily be fertilised by the pollen of\\nM. longiflora, and the hybrids thus produced are sufficiently fertile;\\nbut Kolreuter tried more than two hundred times, during eight following\\nyears, to fertilise reciprocally M. longiflora with the pollen of M.\\njalappa, and utterly failed.', 'Several other equally striking cases could\\nbe given.', 'Thuret has observed the same fact with certain sea-weeds\\nor Fuci.', 'Gartner, moreover, found that this difference of facility in\\nmaking reciprocal crosses is extremely common in a lesser degree.', 'He has\\nobserved it even between forms so closely related (as Matthiola annua\\nand glabra) that many botanists rank them only as varieties.', 'It is also\\na remarkable fact, that hybrids raised from reciprocal crosses, though\\nof course compounded of the very same two species, the one species\\nhaving first been used as the father and then as the mother, generally\\ndiffer in fertility in a small, and occasionally in a high degree.', 'Several other singular rules could be given from Gartner: for instance,\\nsome species have a remarkable power of crossing with other species;\\nother species of the same genus have a remarkable power of impressing\\ntheir likeness on their hybrid offspring; but these two powers do not at\\nall necessarily go together.', 'There are certain hybrids which instead\\nof having, as is usual, an intermediate character between their two\\nparents, always closely resemble one of them; and such hybrids, though\\nexternally so like one of their pure parent-species, are with rare\\nexceptions extremely sterile.', 'So again amongst hybrids which are\\nusually intermediate in structure between their parents, exceptional and\\nabnormal individuals sometimes are born, which closely resemble one of\\ntheir pure parents; and these hybrids are almost always utterly sterile,\\neven when the other hybrids raised from seed from the same capsule have\\na considerable degree of fertility.', 'These facts show how completely\\nfertility in the hybrid is independent of its external resemblance to\\neither pure parent.', 'Considering the several rules now given, which govern the fertility\\nof first crosses and of hybrids, we see that when forms, which must be\\nconsidered as good and distinct species, are united, their fertility\\ngraduates from zero to perfect fertility, or even to fertility under\\ncertain conditions in excess.', 'That their fertility, besides being\\neminently susceptible to favourable and unfavourable conditions, is\\ninnately variable.', 'That it is by no means always the same in degree in\\nthe first cross and in the hybrids produced from this cross.', 'That the\\nfertility of hybrids is not related to the degree in which they resemble\\nin external appearance either parent.', 'And lastly, that the facility of\\nmaking a first cross between any two species is not always governed by\\ntheir systematic affinity or degree of resemblance to each other.', 'This\\nlatter statement is clearly proved by reciprocal crosses between the\\nsame two species, for according as the one species or the other is used\\nas the father or the mother, there is generally some difference,\\nand occasionally the widest possible difference, in the facility of\\neffecting an union.', 'The hybrids, moreover, produced from reciprocal\\ncrosses often differ in fertility.', 'Now do these complex and singular rules indicate that species have been\\nendowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming confounded\\nin nature?', 'I think not.', 'For why should the sterility be so extremely\\ndifferent in degree, when various species are crossed, all of which\\nwe must suppose it would be equally important to keep from blending\\ntogether?', 'Why should the degree of sterility be innately variable in\\nthe individuals of the same species?', 'Why should some species cross with\\nfacility, and yet produce very sterile hybrids; and other species cross\\nwith extreme difficulty, and yet produce fairly fertile hybrids?', 'Why should there often be so great a difference in the result of a\\nreciprocal cross between the same two species?', 'Why, it may even be\\nasked, has the production of hybrids been permitted?', 'to grant to species\\nthe special power of producing hybrids, and then to stop their further\\npropagation by different degrees of sterility, not strictly related to\\nthe facility of the first union between their parents, seems to be a\\nstrange arrangement.', 'The foregoing rules and facts, on the other hand, appear to me clearly\\nto indicate that the sterility both of first crosses and of hybrids is\\nsimply incidental or dependent on unknown differences, chiefly in the\\nreproductive systems, of the species which are crossed.', 'The differences\\nbeing of so peculiar and limited a nature, that, in reciprocal crosses\\nbetween two species the male sexual element of the one will often freely\\nact on the female sexual element of the other, but not in a reversed\\ndirection.', 'It will be advisable to explain a little more fully by an\\nexample what I mean by sterility being incidental on other differences,\\nand not a specially endowed quality.', 'As the capacity of one plant to be\\ngrafted or budded on another is so entirely unimportant for its welfare\\nin a state of nature, I presume that no one will suppose that this\\ncapacity is a SPECIALLY endowed quality, but will admit that it is\\nincidental on differences in the laws of growth of the two plants.', 'We\\ncan sometimes see the reason why one tree will not take on another, from\\ndifferences in their rate of growth, in the hardness of their wood, in\\nthe period of the flow or nature of their sap, etc.', '; but in a multitude\\nof cases we can assign no reason whatever.', 'Great diversity in the size\\nof two plants, one being woody and the other herbaceous, one being\\nevergreen and the other deciduous, and adaptation to widely different\\nclimates, does not always prevent the two grafting together.', 'As in\\nhybridisation, so with grafting, the capacity is limited by systematic\\naffinity, for no one has been able to graft trees together belonging to\\nquite distinct families; and, on the other hand, closely allied species,\\nand varieties of the same species, can usually, but not invariably,\\nbe grafted with ease.', 'But this capacity, as in hybridisation, is by no\\nmeans absolutely governed by systematic affinity.', 'Although many distinct\\ngenera within the same family have been grafted together, in other cases\\nspecies of the same genus will not take on each other.', 'The pear can be\\ngrafted far more readily on the quince, which is ranked as a distinct\\ngenus, than on the apple, which is a member of the same genus.', 'Even\\ndifferent varieties of the pear take with different degrees of facility\\non the quince; so do different varieties of the apricot and peach on\\ncertain varieties of the plum.', 'As Gartner found that there was sometimes an innate difference in\\ndifferent INDIVIDUALS of the same two species in crossing; so Sagaret\\nbelieves this to be the case with different individuals of the same\\ntwo species in being grafted together.', 'As in reciprocal crosses, the\\nfacility of effecting an union is often very far from equal, so it\\nsometimes is in grafting; the common gooseberry, for instance, cannot\\nbe grafted on the currant, whereas the currant will take, though with\\ndifficulty, on the gooseberry.', 'We have seen that the sterility of hybrids, which have their\\nreproductive organs in an imperfect condition, is a very different\\ncase from the difficulty of uniting two pure species, which have their\\nreproductive organs perfect; yet these two distinct cases run to a\\ncertain extent parallel.', 'Something analogous occurs in grafting; for\\nThouin found that three species of Robinia, which seeded freely on\\ntheir own roots, and which could be grafted with no great difficulty on\\nanother species, when thus grafted were rendered barren.', 'On the other\\nhand, certain species of Sorbus, when grafted on other species, yielded\\ntwice as much fruit as when on their own roots.', 'We are reminded by this\\nlatter fact of the extraordinary case of Hippeastrum, Lobelia, etc.,\\nwhich seeded much more freely when fertilised with the pollen of\\ndistinct species, than when self-fertilised with their own pollen.', 'We thus see, that although there is a clear and fundamental difference\\nbetween the mere adhesion of grafted stocks, and the union of the male\\nand female elements in the act of reproduction, yet that there is a\\nrude degree of parallelism in the results of grafting and of crossing\\ndistinct species.', 'And as we must look at the curious and complex laws\\ngoverning the facility with which trees can be grafted on each other\\nas incidental on unknown differences in their vegetative systems, so I\\nbelieve that the still more complex laws governing the facility of\\nfirst crosses, are incidental on unknown differences, chiefly in their\\nreproductive systems.', 'These differences, in both cases, follow to a\\ncertain extent, as might have been expected, systematic affinity, by\\nwhich every kind of resemblance and dissimilarity between organic\\nbeings is attempted to be expressed.', 'The facts by no means seem to me\\nto indicate that the greater or lesser difficulty of either grafting or\\ncrossing together various species has been a special endowment;\\nalthough in the case of crossing, the difficulty is as important for the\\nendurance and stability of specific forms, as in the case of grafting it\\nis unimportant for their welfare.', 'CAUSES OF THE STERILITY OF FIRST CROSSES AND OF HYBRIDS.', 'We may now look a little closer at the probable causes of the sterility\\nof first crosses and of hybrids.', 'These two cases are fundamentally\\ndifferent, for, as just remarked, in the union of two pure species the\\nmale and female sexual elements are perfect, whereas in hybrids they are\\nimperfect.', 'Even in first crosses, the greater or lesser difficulty in\\neffecting a union apparently depends on several distinct causes.', 'There\\nmust sometimes be a physical impossibility in the male element reaching\\nthe ovule, as would be the case with a plant having a pistil too long\\nfor the pollen-tubes to reach the ovarium.', 'It has also been observed\\nthat when pollen of one species is placed on the stigma of a distantly\\nallied species, though the pollen-tubes protrude, they do not penetrate\\nthe stigmatic surface.', \"Again, the male element may reach the female\\nelement, but be incapable of causing an embryo to be developed, as seems\\nto have been the case with some of Thuret's experiments on Fuci.\", 'No\\nexplanation can be given of these facts, any more than why certain trees\\ncannot be grafted on others.', 'Lastly, an embryo may be developed, and\\nthen perish at an early period.', 'This latter alternative has not been\\nsufficiently attended to; but I believe, from observations communicated\\nto me by Mr. Hewitt, who has had great experience in hybridising\\ngallinaceous birds, that the early death of the embryo is a very\\nfrequent cause of sterility in first crosses.', 'I was at first very\\nunwilling to believe in this view; as hybrids, when once born, are\\ngenerally healthy and long-lived, as we see in the case of the common\\nmule.', 'Hybrids, however, are differently circumstanced before and after\\nbirth: when born and living in a country where their two parents can\\nlive, they are generally placed under suitable conditions of life.', \"But\\na hybrid partakes of only half of the nature and constitution of its\\nmother, and therefore before birth, as long as it is nourished within\\nits mother's womb or within the egg or seed produced by the mother, it\\nmay be exposed to conditions in some degree unsuitable, and consequently\\nbe liable to perish at an early period; more especially as all very\\nyoung beings seem eminently sensitive to injurious or unnatural\\nconditions of life.\", 'In regard to the sterility of hybrids, in which the sexual elements are\\nimperfectly developed, the case is very different.', 'I have more than once\\nalluded to a large body of facts, which I have collected, showing that\\nwhen animals and plants are removed from their natural conditions,\\nthey are extremely liable to have their reproductive systems seriously\\naffected.', 'This, in fact, is the great bar to the domestication of\\nanimals.', 'Between the sterility thus superinduced and that of hybrids,\\nthere are many points of similarity.', 'In both cases the sterility is\\nindependent of general health, and is often accompanied by excess of\\nsize or great luxuriance.', 'In both cases, the sterility occurs in various\\ndegrees; in both, the male element is the most liable to be affected;\\nbut sometimes the female more than the male.', 'In both, the tendency\\ngoes to a certain extent with systematic affinity, for whole groups\\nof animals and plants are rendered impotent by the same unnatural\\nconditions; and whole groups of species tend to produce sterile hybrids.', 'On the other hand, one species in a group will sometimes resist great\\nchanges of conditions with unimpaired fertility; and certain species in\\na group will produce unusually fertile hybrids.', 'No one can tell, till he\\ntries, whether any particular animal will breed under confinement or any\\nplant seed freely under culture; nor can he tell, till he tries, whether\\nany two species of a genus will produce more or less sterile hybrids.', 'Lastly, when organic beings are placed during several generations under\\nconditions not natural to them, they are extremely liable to vary,\\nwhich is due, as I believe, to their reproductive systems having been\\nspecially affected, though in a lesser degree than when sterility\\nensues.', 'So it is with hybrids, for hybrids in successive generations are\\neminently liable to vary, as every experimentalist has observed.', 'Thus we see that when organic beings are placed under new and unnatural\\nconditions, and when hybrids are produced by the unnatural crossing of\\ntwo species, the reproductive system, independently of the general state\\nof health, is affected by sterility in a very similar manner.', 'In the\\none case, the conditions of life have been disturbed, though often in so\\nslight a degree as to be inappreciable by us; in the other case, or\\nthat of hybrids, the external conditions have remained the same, but\\nthe organisation has been disturbed by two different structures and\\nconstitutions having been blended into one.', 'For it is scarcely possible\\nthat two organisations should be compounded into one, without some\\ndisturbance occurring in the development, or periodical action, or\\nmutual relation of the different parts and organs one to another, or to\\nthe conditions of life.', 'When hybrids are able to breed inter se, they\\ntransmit to their offspring from generation to generation the same\\ncompounded organisation, and hence we need not be surprised that their\\nsterility, though in some degree variable, rarely diminishes.', 'It must, however, be confessed that we cannot understand, excepting\\non vague hypotheses, several facts with respect to the sterility of\\nhybrids; for instance, the unequal fertility of hybrids produced from\\nreciprocal crosses; or the increased sterility in those hybrids which\\noccasionally and exceptionally resemble closely either pure parent.', 'Nor\\ndo I pretend that the foregoing remarks go to the root of the matter:\\nno explanation is offered why an organism, when placed under unnatural\\nconditions, is rendered sterile.', 'All that I have attempted to show,\\nis that in two cases, in some respects allied, sterility is the common\\nresult,--in the one case from the conditions of life having been\\ndisturbed, in the other case from the organisation having been disturbed\\nby two organisations having been compounded into one.', 'It may seem fanciful, but I suspect that a similar parallelism extends\\nto an allied yet very different class of facts.', 'It is an old and almost\\nuniversal belief, founded, I think, on a considerable body of evidence,\\nthat slight changes in the conditions of life are beneficial to all\\nliving things.', 'We see this acted on by farmers and gardeners in their\\nfrequent exchanges of seed, tubers, etc., from one soil or climate to\\nanother, and back again.', 'During the convalescence of animals, we plainly\\nsee that great benefit is derived from almost any change in the\\nhabits of life.', 'Again, both with plants and animals, there is abundant\\nevidence, that a cross between very distinct individuals of the same\\nspecies, that is between members of different strains or sub-breeds,\\ngives vigour and fertility to the offspring.', 'I believe, indeed, from\\nthe facts alluded to in our fourth chapter, that a certain amount of\\ncrossing is indispensable even with hermaphrodites; and that close\\ninterbreeding continued during several generations between the nearest\\nrelations, especially if these be kept under the same conditions of\\nlife, always induces weakness and sterility in the progeny.', 'Hence it seems that, on the one hand, slight changes in the conditions\\nof life benefit all organic beings, and on the other hand, that slight\\ncrosses, that is crosses between the males and females of the same\\nspecies which have varied and become slightly different, give vigour and\\nfertility to the offspring.', 'But we have seen that greater changes, or\\nchanges of a particular nature, often render organic beings in some\\ndegree sterile; and that greater crosses, that is crosses between males\\nand females which have become widely or specifically different, produce\\nhybrids which are generally sterile in some degree.', 'I cannot persuade\\nmyself that this parallelism is an accident or an illusion.', 'Both series\\nof facts seem to be connected together by some common but unknown bond,\\nwhich is essentially related to the principle of life.', 'FERTILITY OF VARIETIES WHEN CROSSED, AND OF THEIR MONGREL OFFSPRING.', 'It may be urged, as a most forcible argument, that there must be some\\nessential distinction between species and varieties, and that there\\nmust be some error in all the foregoing remarks, inasmuch as varieties,\\nhowever much they may differ from each other in external appearance,\\ncross with perfect facility, and yield perfectly fertile offspring.', 'I\\nfully admit that this is almost invariably the case.', 'But if we look to\\nvarieties produced under nature, we are immediately involved in hopeless\\ndifficulties; for if two hitherto reputed varieties be found in any\\ndegree sterile together, they are at once ranked by most naturalists\\nas species.', 'For instance, the blue and red pimpernel, the primrose\\nand cowslip, which are considered by many of our best botanists as\\nvarieties, are said by Gartner not to be quite fertile when crossed, and\\nhe consequently ranks them as undoubted species.', 'If we thus argue in\\na circle, the fertility of all varieties produced under nature will\\nassuredly have to be granted.', 'If we turn to varieties, produced, or supposed to have been produced,\\nunder domestication, we are still involved in doubt.', 'For when it is\\nstated, for instance, that the German Spitz dog unites more easily\\nthan other dogs with foxes, or that certain South American indigenous\\ndomestic dogs do not readily cross with European dogs, the explanation\\nwhich will occur to everyone, and probably the true one, is that\\nthese dogs have descended from several aboriginally distinct species.', 'Nevertheless the perfect fertility of so many domestic varieties,\\ndiffering widely from each other in appearance, for instance of the\\npigeon or of the cabbage, is a remarkable fact; more especially when we\\nreflect how many species there are, which, though resembling each\\nother most closely, are utterly sterile when intercrossed.', 'Several\\nconsiderations, however, render the fertility of domestic varieties less\\nremarkable than at first appears.', 'It can, in the first place, be clearly\\nshown that mere external dissimilarity between two species does not\\ndetermine their greater or lesser degree of sterility when crossed; and\\nwe may apply the same rule to domestic varieties.', 'In the second place,\\nsome eminent naturalists believe that a long course of domestication\\ntends to eliminate sterility in the successive generations of hybrids,\\nwhich were at first only slightly sterile; and if this be so, we surely\\nought not to expect to find sterility both appearing and disappearing\\nunder nearly the same conditions of life.', \"Lastly, and this seems to me\\nby far the most important consideration, new races of animals and plants\\nare produced under domestication by man's methodical and unconscious\\npower of selection, for his own use and pleasure: he neither wishes to\\nselect, nor could select, slight differences in the reproductive system,\\nor other constitutional differences correlated with the reproductive\\nsystem.\", 'He supplies his several varieties with the same food; treats\\nthem in nearly the same manner, and does not wish to alter their general\\nhabits of life.', \"Nature acts uniformly and slowly during vast periods\\nof time on the whole organisation, in any way which may be for each\\ncreature's own good; and thus she may, either directly, or more probably\\nindirectly, through correlation, modify the reproductive system in the\\nseveral descendants from any one species.\", 'Seeing this difference in the\\nprocess of selection, as carried on by man and nature, we need not be\\nsurprised at some difference in the result.', 'I have as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same species were\\ninvariably fertile when intercrossed.', 'But it seems to me impossible to\\nresist the evidence of the existence of a certain amount of sterility in\\nthe few following cases, which I will briefly abstract.', 'The evidence\\nis at least as good as that from which we believe in the sterility of\\na multitude of species.', 'The evidence is, also, derived from hostile\\nwitnesses, who in all other cases consider fertility and sterility as\\nsafe criterions of specific distinction.', 'Gartner kept during several\\nyears a dwarf kind of maize with yellow seeds, and a tall variety with\\nred seeds, growing near each other in his garden; and although these\\nplants have separated sexes, they never naturally crossed.', 'He then\\nfertilised thirteen flowers of the one with the pollen of the other; but\\nonly a single head produced any seed, and this one head produced only\\nfive grains.', 'Manipulation in this case could not have been injurious, as\\nthe plants have separated sexes.', 'No one, I believe, has suspected that\\nthese varieties of maize are distinct species; and it is important to\\nnotice that the hybrid plants thus raised were themselves PERFECTLY\\nfertile; so that even Gartner did not venture to consider the two\\nvarieties as specifically distinct.', 'Girou de Buzareingues crossed three varieties of gourd, which like\\nthe maize has separated sexes, and he asserts that their mutual\\nfertilisation is by so much the less easy as their differences are\\ngreater.', 'How far these experiments may be trusted, I know not; but the\\nforms experimentised on, are ranked by Sagaret, who mainly founds his\\nclassification by the test of infertility, as varieties.', 'The following case is far more remarkable, and seems at first quite\\nincredible; but it is the result of an astonishing number of experiments\\nmade during many years on nine species of Verbascum, by so good an\\nobserver and so hostile a witness, as Gartner: namely, that yellow\\nand white varieties of the same species of Verbascum when intercrossed\\nproduce less seed, than do either coloured varieties when fertilised\\nwith pollen from their own coloured flowers.', 'Moreover, he asserts that\\nwhen yellow and white varieties of one species are crossed with yellow\\nand white varieties of a DISTINCT species, more seed is produced by the\\ncrosses between the same coloured flowers, than between those which are\\ndifferently coloured.', 'Yet these varieties of Verbascum present no other\\ndifference besides the mere colour of the flower; and one variety can\\nsometimes be raised from the seed of the other.', 'From observations which I have made on certain varieties of hollyhock, I\\nam inclined to suspect that they present analogous facts.', 'Kolreuter, whose accuracy has been confirmed by every subsequent\\nobserver, has proved the remarkable fact, that one variety of the common\\ntobacco is more fertile, when crossed with a widely distinct species,\\nthan are the other varieties.', 'He experimentised on five forms, which are\\ncommonly reputed to be varieties, and which he tested by the severest\\ntrial, namely, by reciprocal crosses, and he found their mongrel\\noffspring perfectly fertile.', 'But one of these five varieties, when used\\neither as father or mother, and crossed with the Nicotiana glutinosa,\\nalways yielded hybrids not so sterile as those which were produced\\nfrom the four other varieties when crossed with N. glutinosa.', 'Hence the\\nreproductive system of this one variety must have been in some manner\\nand in some degree modified.', 'From these facts; from the great difficulty of ascertaining the\\ninfertility of varieties in a state of nature, for a supposed variety if\\ninfertile in any degree would generally be ranked as species; from\\nman selecting only external characters in the production of the most\\ndistinct domestic varieties, and from not wishing or being able to\\nproduce recondite and functional differences in the reproductive system;\\nfrom these several considerations and facts, I do not think that the\\nvery general fertility of varieties can be proved to be of universal\\noccurrence, or to form a fundamental distinction between varieties\\nand species.', 'The general fertility of varieties does not seem to me\\nsufficient to overthrow the view which I have taken with respect to\\nthe very general, but not invariable, sterility of first crosses and of\\nhybrids, namely, that it is not a special endowment, but is incidental\\non slowly acquired modifications, more especially in the reproductive\\nsystems of the forms which are crossed.', 'HYBRIDS AND MONGRELS COMPARED, INDEPENDENTLY OF THEIR FERTILITY.', 'Independently of the question of fertility, the offspring of species\\nwhen crossed and of varieties when crossed may be compared in several\\nother respects.', 'Gartner, whose strong wish was to draw a marked line of\\ndistinction between species and varieties, could find very few and,\\nas it seems to me, quite unimportant differences between the so-called\\nhybrid offspring of species, and the so-called mongrel offspring of\\nvarieties.', 'And, on the other hand, they agree most closely in very many\\nimportant respects.', 'I shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity.', 'The most\\nimportant distinction is, that in the first generation mongrels are\\nmore variable than hybrids; but Gartner admits that hybrids from\\nspecies which have long been cultivated are often variable in the first\\ngeneration; and I have myself seen striking instances of this fact.', 'Gartner further admits that hybrids between very closely allied species\\nare more variable than those from very distinct species; and this shows\\nthat the difference in the degree of variability graduates away.', 'When mongrels and the more fertile hybrids are propagated for several\\ngenerations an extreme amount of variability in their offspring\\nis notorious; but some few cases both of hybrids and mongrels long\\nretaining uniformity of character could be given.', 'The variability,\\nhowever, in the successive generations of mongrels is, perhaps, greater\\nthan in hybrids.', 'This greater variability of mongrels than of hybrids does not seem to me\\nat all surprising.', 'For the parents of mongrels are varieties, and mostly\\ndomestic varieties (very few experiments having been tried on natural\\nvarieties), and this implies in most cases that there has been recent\\nvariability; and therefore we might expect that such variability would\\noften continue and be super-added to that arising from the mere act of\\ncrossing.', 'The slight degree of variability in hybrids from the first\\ncross or in the first generation, in contrast with their extreme\\nvariability in the succeeding generations, is a curious fact and\\ndeserves attention.', 'For it bears on and corroborates the view which I\\nhave taken on the cause of ordinary variability; namely, that it is due\\nto the reproductive system being eminently sensitive to any change in\\nthe conditions of life, being thus often rendered either impotent or at\\nleast incapable of its proper function of producing offspring identical\\nwith the parent-form.', 'Now hybrids in the first generation are descended\\nfrom species (excluding those long cultivated) which have not had their\\nreproductive systems in any way affected, and they are not variable; but\\nhybrids themselves have their reproductive systems seriously affected,\\nand their descendants are highly variable.', 'But to return to our comparison of mongrels and hybrids: Gartner\\nstates that mongrels are more liable than hybrids to revert to either\\nparent-form; but this, if it be true, is certainly only a difference in\\ndegree.', 'Gartner further insists that when any two species, although\\nmost closely allied to each other, are crossed with a third species,\\nthe hybrids are widely different from each other; whereas if two very\\ndistinct varieties of one species are crossed with another species, the\\nhybrids do not differ much.', 'But this conclusion, as far as I can make\\nout, is founded on a single experiment; and seems directly opposed to\\nthe results of several experiments made by Kolreuter.', 'These alone are the unimportant differences, which Gartner is able to\\npoint out, between hybrid and mongrel plants.', 'On the other hand, the\\nresemblance in mongrels and in hybrids to their respective parents,\\nmore especially in hybrids produced from nearly related species, follows\\naccording to Gartner the same laws.', 'When two species are crossed,\\none has sometimes a prepotent power of impressing its likeness on the\\nhybrid; and so I believe it to be with varieties of plants.', 'With animals\\none variety certainly often has this prepotent power over another\\nvariety.', 'Hybrid plants produced from a reciprocal cross, generally\\nresemble each other closely; and so it is with mongrels from a\\nreciprocal cross.', 'Both hybrids and mongrels can be reduced to either\\npure parent-form, by repeated crosses in successive generations with\\neither parent.', 'These several remarks are apparently applicable to animals; but the\\nsubject is here excessively complicated, partly owing to the existence\\nof secondary sexual characters; but more especially owing to prepotency\\nin transmitting likeness running more strongly in one sex than in the\\nother, both when one species is crossed with another, and when one\\nvariety is crossed with another variety.', 'For instance, I think those\\nauthors are right, who maintain that the ass has a prepotent power over\\nthe horse, so that both the mule and the hinny more resemble the ass\\nthan the horse; but that the prepotency runs more strongly in the\\nmale-ass than in the female, so that the mule, which is the offspring of\\nthe male-ass and mare, is more like an ass, than is the hinny, which is\\nthe offspring of the female-ass and stallion.', 'Much stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact, that\\nmongrel animals alone are born closely like one of their parents; but\\nit can be shown that this does sometimes occur with hybrids; yet I grant\\nmuch less frequently with hybrids than with mongrels.', 'Looking to the\\ncases which I have collected of cross-bred animals closely resembling\\none parent, the resemblances seem chiefly confined to characters almost\\nmonstrous in their nature, and which have suddenly appeared--such as\\nalbinism, melanism, deficiency of tail or horns, or additional fingers\\nand toes; and do not relate to characters which have been slowly\\nacquired by selection.', 'Consequently, sudden reversions to the perfect\\ncharacter of either parent would be more likely to occur with mongrels,\\nwhich are descended from varieties often suddenly produced and\\nsemi-monstrous in character, than with hybrids, which are descended from\\nspecies slowly and naturally produced.', 'On the whole I entirely agree\\nwith Dr. Prosper Lucas, who, after arranging an enormous body of facts\\nwith respect to animals, comes to the conclusion, that the laws of\\nresemblance of the child to its parents are the same, whether the two\\nparents differ much or little from each other, namely in the union\\nof individuals of the same variety, or of different varieties, or of\\ndistinct species.', 'Laying aside the question of fertility and sterility, in all other\\nrespects there seems to be a general and close similarity in the\\noffspring of crossed species, and of crossed varieties.', 'If we look at\\nspecies as having been specially created, and at varieties as having\\nbeen produced by secondary laws, this similarity would be an astonishing\\nfact.', 'But it harmonises perfectly with the view that there is no\\nessential distinction between species and varieties.', 'SUMMARY OF CHAPTER.', 'First crosses between forms sufficiently distinct to be ranked as\\nspecies, and their hybrids, are very generally, but not universally,\\nsterile.', 'The sterility is of all degrees, and is often so slight that\\nthe two most careful experimentalists who have ever lived, have come to\\ndiametrically opposite conclusions in ranking forms by this test.', 'The\\nsterility is innately variable in individuals of the same species, and\\nis eminently susceptible of favourable and unfavourable conditions.', 'The\\ndegree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity, but is\\ngoverned by several curious and complex laws.', 'It is generally different,\\nand sometimes widely different, in reciprocal crosses between the same\\ntwo species.', 'It is not always equal in degree in a first cross and in\\nthe hybrid produced from this cross.', 'In the same manner as in grafting trees, the capacity of one species\\nor variety to take on another, is incidental on generally unknown\\ndifferences in their vegetative systems, so in crossing, the greater\\nor less facility of one species to unite with another, is incidental\\non unknown differences in their reproductive systems.', 'There is no more\\nreason to think that species have been specially endowed with various\\ndegrees of sterility to prevent them crossing and blending in nature,\\nthan to think that trees have been specially endowed with various and\\nsomewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in being grafted together in\\norder to prevent them becoming inarched in our forests.', 'The sterility of first crosses between pure species, which have their\\nreproductive systems perfect, seems to depend on several circumstances;\\nin some cases largely on the early death of the embryo.', 'The sterility of\\nhybrids, which have their reproductive systems imperfect, and which\\nhave had this system and their whole organisation disturbed by being\\ncompounded of two distinct species, seems closely allied to that\\nsterility which so frequently affects pure species, when their natural\\nconditions of life have been disturbed.', 'This view is supported by a\\nparallelism of another kind;--namely, that the crossing of forms only\\nslightly different is favourable to the vigour and fertility of their\\noffspring; and that slight changes in the conditions of life are\\napparently favourable to the vigour and fertility of all organic beings.', 'It is not surprising that the degree of difficulty in uniting two\\nspecies, and the degree of sterility of their hybrid-offspring should\\ngenerally correspond, though due to distinct causes;

and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection\\nwhich can be urged against my theory.', 'The explanation lies, as I\\nbelieve, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.', 'In the first place it should always be borne in mind what sort of\\nintermediate forms must, on my theory, have formerly existed.', 'I have\\nfound it difficult, when looking at any two species, to avoid picturing\\nto myself, forms DIRECTLY intermediate between them.', 'But this is a\\nwholly false view; we should always look for forms intermediate between\\neach species and a common but unknown progenitor; and the progenitor\\nwill generally have differed in some respects from all its modified\\ndescendants.', 'To give a simple illustration: the fantail and pouter\\npigeons have both descended from the rock-pigeon; if we possessed all\\nthe intermediate varieties which have ever existed, we should have an\\nextremely close series between both and the rock-pigeon; but we should\\nhave no varieties directly intermediate between the fantail and pouter;\\nnone, for instance, combining a tail somewhat expanded with a crop\\nsomewhat enlarged, the characteristic features of these two breeds.', 'These two breeds, moreover, have become so much modified, that if we had\\nno historical or indirect evidence regarding their origin, it would not\\nhave been possible to have determined from a mere comparison of their\\nstructure with that of the rock-pigeon, whether they had descended from\\nthis species or from some other allied species, such as C. oenas.', 'So with natural species, if we look to forms very distinct, for instance\\nto the horse and tapir, we have no reason to suppose that links ever\\nexisted directly intermediate between them, but between each and an\\nunknown common parent.', 'The common parent will have had in its whole\\norganisation much general resemblance to the tapir and to the horse; but\\nin some points of structure may have differed considerably from both,\\neven perhaps more than they differ from each other.', 'Hence in all such\\ncases, we should be unable to recognise the parent-form of any two or\\nmore species, even if we closely compared the structure of the parent\\nwith that of its modified descendants, unless at the same time we had a\\nnearly perfect chain of the intermediate links.', 'It is just possible by my theory, that one of two living forms might\\nhave descended from the other; for instance, a horse from a tapir; and\\nin this case DIRECT intermediate links will have existed between them.', 'But such a case would imply that one form had remained for a very long\\nperiod unaltered, whilst its descendants had undergone a vast amount of\\nchange; and the principle of competition between organism and organism,\\nbetween child and parent, will render this a very rare event; for in all\\ncases the new and improved forms of life will tend to supplant the old\\nand unimproved forms.', 'By the theory of natural selection all living species have been\\nconnected with the parent-species of each genus, by differences not\\ngreater than we see between the varieties of the same species at the\\npresent day;

yet, considering over what wide spaces very fine sediment is\\ntransported by the currents of the sea, the process of accumulation in\\nany one area must be extremely slow.', 'But the amount of denudation which the strata have in many places\\nsuffered, independently of the rate of accumulation of the degraded\\nmatter, probably offers the best evidence of the lapse of time.', 'I\\nremember having been much struck with the evidence of denudation, when\\nviewing volcanic islands, which have been worn by the waves and pared\\nall round into perpendicular cliffs of one or two thousand feet in\\nheight; for the gentle slope of the lava-streams, due to their formerly\\nliquid state, showed at a glance how far the hard, rocky beds had once\\nextended into the open ocean.', 'The same story is still more plainly told\\nby faults,--those great cracks along which the strata have been upheaved\\non one side, or thrown down on the other, to the height or depth of\\nthousands of feet; for since the crust cracked, the surface of the land\\nhas been so completely planed down by the action of the sea, that no\\ntrace of these vast dislocations is externally visible.', 'The Craven fault, for instance, extends for upwards of 30 miles, and\\nalong this line the vertical displacement of the strata has varied\\nfrom 600 to 3000 feet.', 'Professor Ramsay has published an account of\\na downthrow in Anglesea of 2300 feet;

for, remembering that at no great\\ndistance to the west the northern and southern escarpments meet and\\nclose, one can safely picture to oneself the great dome of rocks which\\nmust have covered up the Weald within so limited a period as since the\\nlatter part of the Chalk formation.', 'The distance from the northern to\\nthe southern Downs is about 22 miles, and the thickness of the several\\nformations is on an average about 1100 feet, as I am informed by\\nProfessor Ramsay.', 'But if, as some geologists suppose, a range of\\nolder rocks underlies the Weald, on the flanks of which the overlying\\nsedimentary deposits might have accumulated in thinner masses than\\nelsewhere, the above estimate would be erroneous; but this source of\\ndoubt probably would not greatly affect the estimate as applied to the\\nwestern extremity of the district.', 'If, then, we knew the rate at which\\nthe sea commonly wears away a line of cliff of any given height, we\\ncould measure the time requisite to have denuded the Weald.', 'This, of\\ncourse, cannot be done; but we may, in order to form some crude notion\\non the subject, assume that the sea would eat into cliffs 500 feet in\\nheight at the rate of one inch in a century.', 'This will at first appear\\nmuch too small an allowance; but it is the same as if we were to assume\\na cliff one yard in height to be eaten back along a whole line of\\ncoast at the rate of one yard in nearly every twenty-two years.', 'I\\ndoubt whether any rock, even as soft as chalk, would yield at this rate\\nexcepting on the most exposed coasts; though no doubt the degradation\\nof a lofty cliff would be more rapid from the breakage of the fallen\\nfragments.', 'On the other hand, I do not believe that any line of coast,\\nten or twenty miles in length, ever suffers degradation at the same time\\nalong its whole indented length; and we must remember that almost all\\nstrata contain harder layers or nodules, which from long resisting\\nattrition form a breakwater at the base.', 'Hence, under ordinary\\ncircumstances, I conclude that for a cliff 500 feet in height, a\\ndenudation of one inch per century for the whole length would be an\\nample allowance.', 'At this rate, on the above data, the denudation of the\\nWeald must have required 306,662,400 years; or say three hundred million\\nyears.', 'The action of fresh water on the gently inclined Wealden district, when\\nupraised, could hardly have been great, but it would somewhat reduce the\\nabove estimate.', 'On the other hand, during oscillations of level, which\\nwe know this area has undergone, the surface may have existed for\\nmillions of years as land, and thus have escaped the action of the\\nsea: when deeply submerged for perhaps equally long periods, it would,\\nlikewise, have escaped the action of the coast-waves.', 'So that in all\\nprobability a far longer period than 300 million years has elapsed since\\nthe latter part of the Secondary period.', 'I have made these few remarks because it is highly important for us to\\ngain some notion, however imperfect, of the lapse of years.', 'During each\\nof these years, over the whole world, the land and the water has\\nbeen peopled by hosts of living forms.', 'What an infinite number of\\ngenerations, which the mind cannot grasp, must have succeeded each other\\nin the long roll of years!', 'Now turn to our richest geological museums,\\nand what a paltry display we behold!', 'ON THE POORNESS OF OUR PALAEONTOLOGICAL COLLECTIONS.', 'That our palaeontological collections are very imperfect, is admitted by\\nevery one.', 'The remark of that admirable palaeontologist, the late Edward\\nForbes, should not be forgotten, namely, that numbers of our fossil\\nspecies are known and named from single and often broken specimens, or\\nfrom a few specimens collected on some one spot.', 'Only a small portion\\nof the surface of the earth has been geologically explored, and no part\\nwith sufficient care, as the important discoveries made every year in\\nEurope prove.', 'No organism wholly soft can be preserved.', 'Shells and\\nbones will decay and disappear when left on the bottom of the sea, where\\nsediment is not accumulating.', 'I believe we are continually taking a\\nmost erroneous view, when we tacitly admit to ourselves that sediment\\nis being deposited over nearly the whole bed of the sea, at a rate\\nsufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil remains.', 'Throughout an\\nenormously large proportion of the ocean, the bright blue tint of the\\nwater bespeaks its purity.', 'The many cases on record of a formation\\nconformably covered, after an enormous interval of time, by another\\nand later formation, without the underlying bed having suffered in the\\ninterval any wear and tear, seem explicable only on the view of the\\nbottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an unaltered condition.', 'The remains which do become embedded, if in sand or gravel, will when\\nthe beds are upraised generally be dissolved by the percolation of\\nrain-water.', 'I suspect that but few of the very many animals which live\\non the beach between high and low watermark are preserved.', 'For instance,\\nthe several species of the Chthamalinae (a sub-family of sessile\\ncirripedes) coat the rocks all over the world in infinite numbers: they\\nare all strictly littoral, with the exception of a single Mediterranean\\nspecies, which inhabits deep water and has been found fossil in Sicily,\\nwhereas not one other species has hitherto been found in any tertiary\\nformation: yet it is now known that the genus Chthamalus existed\\nduring the chalk period.', 'The molluscan genus Chiton offers a partially\\nanalogous case.', 'With respect to the terrestrial productions which lived during the\\nSecondary and Palaeozoic periods, it is superfluous to state that our\\nevidence from fossil remains is fragmentary in an extreme degree.', 'For\\ninstance, not a land shell is known belonging to either of these\\nvast periods, with one exception discovered by Sir C.

Forbes, we may\\nconclude that the bottom will be inhabited by extremely few animals, and\\nthe mass when upraised will give a most imperfect record of the forms\\nof life which then existed; or, sediment may be accumulated to any\\nthickness and extent over a shallow bottom, if it continue slowly to\\nsubside.', 'In this latter case, as long as the rate of subsidence and\\nsupply of sediment nearly balance each other, the sea will remain\\nshallow and favourable for life, and thus a fossiliferous formation\\nthick enough, when upraised, to resist any amount of degradation, may be\\nformed.', 'I am convinced that all our ancient formations, which are rich in\\nfossils, have thus been formed during subsidence.', 'Since publishing my\\nviews on this subject in 1845, I have watched the progress of Geology,\\nand have been surprised to note how author after author, in treating\\nof this or that great formation, has come to the conclusion that it was\\naccumulated during subsidence.', 'I may add, that the only ancient tertiary\\nformation on the west coast of South America, which has been bulky\\nenough to resist such degradation as it has as yet suffered, but which\\nwill hardly last to a distant geological age, was certainly deposited\\nduring a downward oscillation of level, and thus gained considerable\\nthickness.', 'All geological facts tell us plainly that each area has undergone\\nnumerous slow oscillations of level, and apparently these oscillations\\nhave affected wide spaces.', 'Consequently formations rich in fossils and\\nsufficiently thick and extensive to resist subsequent degradation, may\\nhave been formed over wide spaces during periods of subsidence, but only\\nwhere the supply of sediment was sufficient to keep the sea shallow and\\nto embed and preserve the remains before they had time to decay.', 'On the\\nother hand, as long as the bed of the sea remained stationary, THICK\\ndeposits could not have been accumulated in the shallow parts, which are\\nthe most favourable to life.', 'Still less could this have happened during\\nthe alternate periods of elevation; or, to speak more accurately, the\\nbeds which were then accumulated will have been destroyed by being\\nupraised and brought within the limits of the coast-action.', 'Thus the geological record will almost necessarily be rendered\\nintermittent.', 'I feel much confidence in the truth of these views, for\\nthey are in strict accordance with the general principles inculcated\\nby Sir C. Lyell; and E. Forbes independently arrived at a similar\\nconclusion.', 'One remark is here worth a passing notice.', 'During periods of elevation\\nthe area of the land and of the adjoining shoal parts of the sea will\\nbe increased, and new stations will often be formed;--all circumstances\\nmost favourable, as previously explained, for the formation of new\\nvarieties and species; but during such periods there will generally be\\na blank in the geological record.', 'On the other hand, during subsidence,\\nthe inhabited area and number of inhabitants will decrease (excepting\\nthe productions on the shores of a continent when first broken up into\\nan archipelago), and consequently during subsidence, though there will\\nbe much extinction, fewer new varieties or species will be formed; and\\nit is during these very periods of subsidence, that our great deposits\\nrich in fossils have been accumulated.', 'Nature may almost be said to have\\nguarded against the frequent discovery of her transitional or linking\\nforms.', 'From the foregoing considerations it cannot be doubted that the\\ngeological record, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect; but if we\\nconfine our attention to any one formation, it becomes more difficult\\nto understand, why we do not therein find closely graduated varieties\\nbetween the allied species which lived at its commencement and at its\\nclose.', 'Some cases are on record of the same species presenting distinct\\nvarieties in the upper and lower parts of the same formation, but, as\\nthey are rare, they may be here passed over.', 'Although each formation has\\nindisputably required a vast number of years for its deposition, I can\\nsee several reasons why each should not include a graduated series\\nof links between the species which then lived; but I can by no\\nmeans pretend to assign due proportional weight to the following\\nconsiderations.', 'Although each formation may mark a very long lapse of years, each\\nperhaps is short compared with the period requisite to change one\\nspecies into another.', 'I am aware that two palaeontologists, whose\\nopinions are worthy of much deference, namely Bronn and Woodward, have\\nconcluded that the average duration of each formation is twice or thrice\\nas long as the average duration of specific forms.', 'But insuperable\\ndifficulties, as it seems to me, prevent us coming to any just\\nconclusion on this head.', 'When we see a species first appearing in the\\nmiddle of any formation, it would be rash in the extreme to infer that\\nit had not elsewhere previously existed.', 'So again when we find a species\\ndisappearing before the uppermost layers have been deposited, it would\\nbe equally rash to suppose that it then became wholly extinct.', 'We forget\\nhow small the area of Europe is compared with the rest of the world;\\nnor have the several stages of the same formation throughout Europe been\\ncorrelated with perfect accuracy.', 'With marine animals of all kinds, we may safely infer a large amount of\\nmigration during climatal and other changes; and when we see a species\\nfirst appearing in any formation, the probability is that it only then\\nfirst immigrated into that area.', 'It is well known, for instance, that\\nseveral species appeared somewhat earlier in the palaeozoic beds of\\nNorth America than in those of Europe; time having apparently been\\nrequired for their migration from the American to the European seas.', 'In\\nexamining the latest deposits of various quarters of the world, it has\\neverywhere been noted, that some few still existing species are common\\nin the deposit, but have become extinct in the immediately surrounding\\nsea; or, conversely, that some are now abundant in the neighbouring sea,\\nbut are rare or absent in this particular deposit.', 'It is an excellent\\nlesson to reflect on the ascertained amount of migration of the\\ninhabitants of Europe during the Glacial period, which forms only a part\\nof one whole geological period; and likewise to reflect on the great\\nchanges of level, on the inordinately great change of climate, on the\\nprodigious lapse of time, all included within this same glacial period.', 'Yet it may be doubted whether in any quarter of the world, sedimentary\\ndeposits, INCLUDING FOSSIL REMAINS, have gone on accumulating within\\nthe same area during the whole of this period.', 'It is not, for instance,\\nprobable that sediment was deposited during the whole of the glacial\\nperiod near the mouth of the Mississippi, within that limit of depth at\\nwhich marine animals can flourish; for we know what vast geographical\\nchanges occurred in other parts of America during this space of time.', 'When such beds as were deposited in shallow water near the mouth of\\nthe Mississippi during some part of the glacial period shall have been\\nupraised, organic remains will probably first appear and disappear at\\ndifferent levels, owing to the migration of species and to geographical\\nchanges.', 'And in the distant future, a geologist examining these beds,\\nmight be tempted to conclude that the average duration of life of the\\nembedded fossils had been less than that of the glacial period, instead\\nof having been really far greater, that is extending from before the\\nglacial epoch to the present day.', 'In order to get a perfect gradation between two forms in the upper\\nand lower parts of the same formation, the deposit must have gone on\\naccumulating for a very long period, in order to have given sufficient\\ntime for the slow process of variation; hence the deposit will generally\\nhave to be a very thick one; and the species undergoing modification\\nwill have had to live on the same area throughout this whole time.', 'But we have seen that a thick fossiliferous formation can only be\\naccumulated during a period of subsidence; and to keep the depth\\napproximately the same, which is necessary in order to enable the same\\nspecies to live on the same space, the supply of sediment must nearly\\nhave counterbalanced the amount of subsidence.', 'But this same movement\\nof subsidence will often tend to sink the area whence the sediment\\nis derived, and thus diminish the supply whilst the downward movement\\ncontinues.', 'In fact, this nearly exact balancing between the supply of\\nsediment and the amount of subsidence is probably a rare contingency;\\nfor it has been observed by more than one palaeontologist, that very\\nthick deposits are usually barren of organic remains, except near their\\nupper or lower limits.', 'It would seem that each separate formation, like the whole pile of\\nformations in any country, has generally been intermittent in its\\naccumulation.', 'When we see, as is so often the case, a formation composed\\nof beds of different mineralogical composition, we may reasonably\\nsuspect that the process of deposition has been much interrupted, as\\na change in the currents of the sea and a supply of sediment of a\\ndifferent nature will generally have been due to geographical changes\\nrequiring much time.', 'Nor will the closest inspection of a formation give\\nany idea of the time which its deposition has consumed.', 'Many instances\\ncould be given of beds only a few feet in thickness, representing\\nformations, elsewhere thousands of feet in thickness, and which must\\nhave required an enormous period for their accumulation; yet no one\\nignorant of this fact would have suspected the vast lapse of time\\nrepresented by the thinner formation.', 'Many cases could be given of the\\nlower beds of a formation having been upraised, denuded, submerged, and\\nthen re-covered by the upper beds of the same formation,--facts,\\nshowing what wide, yet easily overlooked, intervals have occurred in\\nits accumulation.', 'In other cases we have the plainest evidence in great\\nfossilised trees, still standing upright as they grew, of many long\\nintervals of time and changes of level during the process of deposition,\\nwhich would never even have been suspected, had not the trees chanced to\\nhave been preserved: thus, Messrs. Lyell and Dawson found carboniferous\\nbeds 1400 feet thick in Nova Scotia, with ancient root-bearing strata,\\none above the other, at no less than sixty-eight different levels.', 'Hence, when the same species occur at the bottom, middle, and top of a\\nformation, the probability is that they have not lived on the same\\nspot during the whole period of deposition, but have disappeared and\\nreappeared, perhaps many times, during the same geological period.', 'So that if such species were to undergo a considerable amount of\\nmodification during any one geological period, a section would not\\nprobably include all the fine intermediate gradations which must on\\nmy theory have existed between them, but abrupt, though perhaps very\\nslight, changes of form.', 'It is all-important to remember that naturalists have no golden rule\\nby which to distinguish species and varieties; they grant some little\\nvariability to each species, but when they meet with a somewhat greater\\namount of difference between any two forms, they rank both as species,\\nunless they are enabled to connect them together by close intermediate\\ngradations.', 'And this from the reasons just assigned we can seldom hope\\nto effect in any one geological section.', 'Supposing B and C to be two\\nspecies, and a third, A, to be found in an underlying bed; even if A\\nwere strictly intermediate between B and C, it would simply be ranked as\\na third and distinct species, unless at the same time it could be\\nmost closely connected with either one or both forms by intermediate\\nvarieties.', 'Nor should it be forgotten, as before explained, that A\\nmight be the actual progenitor of B and C, and yet might not at all\\nnecessarily be strictly intermediate between them in all points of\\nstructure.', 'So that we might obtain the parent-species and its several\\nmodified descendants from the lower and upper beds of a formation,\\nand unless we obtained numerous transitional gradations, we should not\\nrecognise their relationship, and should consequently be compelled to\\nrank them all as distinct species.', 'It is notorious on what excessively slight differences many\\npalaeontologists have founded their species; and they do this the more\\nreadily if the specimens come from different sub-stages of the same\\nformation.', \"Some experienced conchologists are now sinking many of the\\nvery fine species of D'Orbigny and others into the rank of varieties;\\nand on this view we do find the kind of evidence of change which on my\\ntheory we ought to find.\", 'Moreover, if we look to rather wider intervals,\\nnamely, to distinct but consecutive stages of the same great formation,\\nwe find that the embedded fossils, though almost universally ranked as\\nspecifically different, yet are far more closely allied to each other\\nthan are the species found in more widely separated formations; but to\\nthis subject I shall have to return in the following chapter.', 'One other consideration is worth notice: with animals and plants that\\ncan propagate rapidly and are not highly locomotive, there is reason to\\nsuspect, as we have formerly seen, that their varieties are generally\\nat first local; and that such local varieties do not spread widely and\\nsupplant their parent-forms until they have been modified and perfected\\nin some considerable degree.', 'According to this view, the chance of\\ndiscovering in a formation in any one country all the early stages of\\ntransition between any two forms, is small, for the successive changes\\nare supposed to have been local or confined to some one spot.', 'Most\\nmarine animals have a wide range; and we have seen that with plants it\\nis those which have the widest range, that oftenest present varieties;\\nso that with shells and other marine animals, it is probably those\\nwhich have had the widest range, far exceeding the limits of the known\\ngeological formations of Europe, which have oftenest given rise, first\\nto local varieties and ultimately to new species; and this again would\\ngreatly lessen the chance of our being able to trace the stages of\\ntransition in any one geological formation.', 'It should not be forgotten, that at the present day, with perfect\\nspecimens for examination, two forms can seldom be connected by\\nintermediate varieties and thus proved to be the same species, until\\nmany specimens have been collected from many places; and in the case\\nof fossil species this could rarely be effected by palaeontologists.', 'We\\nshall, perhaps, best perceive the improbability of our being enabled to\\nconnect species by numerous, fine, intermediate, fossil links, by asking\\nourselves whether, for instance, geologists at some future period will\\nbe able to prove, that our different breeds of cattle, sheep, horses,\\nand dogs have descended from a single stock or from several aboriginal\\nstocks; or, again, whether certain sea-shells inhabiting the shores\\nof North America, which are ranked by some conchologists as distinct\\nspecies from their European representatives, and by other conchologists\\nas only varieties, are really varieties or are, as it is called,\\nspecifically distinct.', 'This could be effected only by the future\\ngeologist discovering in a fossil state numerous intermediate\\ngradations; and such success seems to me improbable in the highest\\ndegree.', 'Geological research, though it has added numerous species to existing\\nand extinct genera, and has made the intervals between some few groups\\nless wide than they otherwise would have been, yet has done scarcely\\nanything in breaking down the distinction between species, by connecting\\nthem together by numerous, fine, intermediate varieties; and this not\\nhaving been effected, is probably the gravest and most obvious of all\\nthe many objections which may be urged against my views.', 'Hence it will\\nbe worth while to sum up the foregoing remarks, under an imaginary\\nillustration.', 'The Malay Archipelago is of about the size of Europe from\\nthe North Cape to the Mediterranean, and from Britain to Russia; and\\ntherefore equals all the geological formations which have been examined\\nwith any accuracy, excepting those of the United States of America.', 'I\\nfully agree with Mr. Godwin-Austen, that the present condition of the\\nMalay Archipelago, with its numerous large islands separated by wide and\\nshallow seas, probably represents the former state of Europe, when most\\nof our formations were accumulating.', 'The Malay Archipelago is one of\\nthe richest regions of the whole world in organic beings; yet if all\\nthe species were to be collected which have ever lived there, how\\nimperfectly would they represent the natural history of the world!', 'But we have every reason to believe that the terrestrial productions of\\nthe archipelago would be preserved in an excessively imperfect manner in\\nthe formations which we suppose to be there accumulating.', 'I suspect that\\nnot many of the strictly littoral animals, or of those which lived on\\nnaked submarine rocks, would be embedded; and those embedded in gravel\\nor sand, would not endure to a distant epoch.', 'Wherever sediment did not\\naccumulate on the bed of the sea, or where it did not accumulate at a\\nsufficient rate to protect organic bodies from decay, no remains could\\nbe preserved.', 'In our archipelago, I believe that fossiliferous formations could be\\nformed of sufficient thickness to last to an age, as distant in futurity\\nas the secondary formations lie in the past, only during periods of\\nsubsidence.', 'These periods of subsidence would be separated from each\\nother by enormous intervals, during which the area would be either\\nstationary or rising; whilst rising, each fossiliferous formation\\nwould be destroyed, almost as soon as accumulated, by the incessant\\ncoast-action, as we now see on the shores of South America.', 'During the\\nperiods of subsidence there would probably be much extinction of life;\\nduring the periods of elevation, there would be much variation, but the\\ngeological record would then be least perfect.', 'It may be doubted whether the duration of any one great period of\\nsubsidence over the whole or part of the archipelago, together with\\na contemporaneous accumulation of sediment, would EXCEED the average\\nduration of the same specific forms; and these contingencies are\\nindispensable for the preservation of all the transitional gradations\\nbetween any two or more species.', 'If such gradations were not fully\\npreserved, transitional varieties would merely appear as so many\\ndistinct species.', 'It is, also, probable that each great period of\\nsubsidence would be interrupted by oscillations of level, and that\\nslight climatal changes would intervene during such lengthy periods; and\\nin these cases the inhabitants of the archipelago would have to migrate,\\nand no closely consecutive record of their modifications could be\\npreserved in any one formation.', 'Very many of the marine inhabitants of the archipelago now range\\nthousands of miles beyond its confines; and analogy leads me to believe\\nthat it would be chiefly these far-ranging species which would oftenest\\nproduce new varieties; and the varieties would at first generally\\nbe local or confined to one place, but if possessed of any decided\\nadvantage, or when further modified and improved, they would slowly\\nspread and supplant their parent-forms.', 'When such varieties returned to\\ntheir ancient homes, as they would differ from their former state, in\\na nearly uniform, though perhaps extremely slight degree, they would,\\naccording to the principles followed by many palaeontologists, be ranked\\nas new and distinct species.', 'If then, there be some degree of truth in these remarks, we have no\\nright to expect to find in our geological formations, an infinite number\\nof those fine transitional forms, which on my theory assuredly have\\nconnected all the past and present species of the same group into one\\nlong and branching chain of life.', 'We ought only to look for a few links,\\nsome more closely, some more distantly related to each other; and these\\nlinks, let them be ever so close, if found in different stages of the\\nsame formation, would, by most palaeontologists, be ranked as distinct\\nspecies.', 'But I do not pretend that I should ever have suspected how poor\\na record of the mutations of life, the best preserved geological section\\npresented, had not the difficulty of our not discovering innumerable\\ntransitional links between the species which appeared at the\\ncommencement and close of each formation, pressed so hardly on my\\ntheory.', 'ON THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF WHOLE GROUPS OF ALLIED SPECIES.', 'The abrupt manner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear in\\ncertain formations, has been urged by several palaeontologists,\\nfor instance, by Agassiz, Pictet, and by none more forcibly than\\nby Professor Sedgwick, as a fatal objection to the belief in the\\ntransmutation of species.', 'If numerous species, belonging to the same\\ngenera or families, have really started into life all at once, the fact\\nwould be fatal to the theory of descent with slow modification through\\nnatural selection.', 'For the development of a group of forms, all of which\\nhave descended from some one progenitor, must have been an extremely\\nslow process; and the progenitors must have lived long ages before their\\nmodified descendants.', 'But we continually over-rate the perfection of the\\ngeological record, and falsely infer, because certain genera or families\\nhave not been found beneath a certain stage, that they did not exist\\nbefore that stage.', 'We continually forget how large the world is,\\ncompared with the area over which our geological formations have been\\ncarefully examined; we forget that groups of species may elsewhere have\\nlong existed and have slowly multiplied before they invaded the ancient\\narchipelagoes of Europe and of the United States.', 'We do not make due\\nallowance for the enormous intervals of time, which have probably\\nelapsed between our consecutive formations,--longer perhaps in some\\ncases than the time required for the accumulation of each formation.', 'These intervals will have given time for the multiplication of species\\nfrom some one or some few parent-forms; and in the succeeding formation\\nsuch species will appear as if suddenly created.', 'I may here recall a remark formerly made, namely that it might require\\na long succession of ages to adapt an organism to some new and peculiar\\nline of life, for instance to fly through the air; but that when this\\nhad been effected, and a few species had thus acquired a great advantage\\nover other organisms, a comparatively short time would be necessary to\\nproduce many divergent forms, which would be able to spread rapidly and\\nwidely throughout the world.', 'I will now give a few examples to illustrate these remarks; and to show\\nhow liable we are to error in supposing that whole groups of species\\nhave suddenly been produced.', 'I may recall the well-known fact that in\\ngeological treatises, published not many years ago, the great class\\nof mammals was always spoken of as having abruptly come in at the\\ncommencement of the tertiary series.', 'And now one of the richest known\\naccumulations of fossil mammals belongs to the middle of the secondary\\nseries; and one true mammal has been discovered in the new red sandstone\\nat nearly the commencement of this great series.', 'Cuvier used to urge\\nthat no monkey occurred in any tertiary stratum; but now extinct species\\nhave been discovered in India, South America, and in Europe even as far\\nback as the eocene stage.', 'The most striking case, however, is that of\\nthe Whale family; as these animals have huge bones, are marine, and\\nrange over the world, the fact of not a single bone of a whale having\\nbeen discovered in any secondary formation, seemed fully to justify the\\nbelief that this great and distinct order had been suddenly produced\\nin the interval between the latest secondary and earliest tertiary\\nformation.', \"But now we may read in the Supplement to Lyell's 'Manual,'\\npublished in 1858, clear evidence of the existence of whales in the\\nupper greensand, some time before the close of the secondary period.\", 'I may give another instance, which from having passed under my own eyes\\nhas much struck me.', 'In a memoir on Fossil Sessile Cirripedes, I have\\nstated that, from the number of existing and extinct tertiary species;\\nfrom the extraordinary abundance of the individuals of many species\\nall over the world, from the Arctic regions to the equator, inhabiting\\nvarious zones of depths from the upper tidal limits to 50 fathoms;\\nfrom the perfect manner in which specimens are preserved in the oldest\\ntertiary beds; from the ease with which even a fragment of a valve can\\nbe recognised; from all these circumstances, I inferred that had sessile\\ncirripedes existed during the secondary periods, they would certainly\\nhave been preserved and discovered; and as not one species had been\\ndiscovered in beds of this age, I concluded that this great group had\\nbeen suddenly developed at the commencement of the tertiary series.', 'This\\nwas a sore trouble to me, adding as I thought one more instance of the\\nabrupt appearance of a great group of species.', 'But my work had hardly\\nbeen published, when a skilful palaeontologist, M. Bosquet, sent me a\\ndrawing of a perfect specimen of an unmistakeable sessile cirripede,\\nwhich he had himself extracted from the chalk of Belgium.', 'And, as if\\nto make the case as striking as possible, this sessile cirripede was a\\nChthamalus, a very common, large, and ubiquitous genus, of which not one\\nspecimen has as yet been found even in any tertiary stratum.', 'Hence we\\nnow positively know that sessile cirripedes existed during the secondary\\nperiod; and these cirripedes might have been the progenitors of our many\\ntertiary and existing species.', 'The case most frequently insisted on by palaeontologists of the\\napparently sudden appearance of a whole group of species, is that of the\\nteleostean fishes, low down in the Chalk period.', 'This group includes the\\nlarge majority of existing species.', 'Lately, Professor Pictet has carried\\ntheir existence one sub-stage further back; and some palaeontologists\\nbelieve that certain much older fishes, of which the affinities are as\\nyet imperfectly known, are really teleostean.', 'Assuming, however, that\\nthe whole of them did appear, as Agassiz believes, at the commencement\\nof the chalk formation, the fact would certainly be highly remarkable;\\nbut I cannot see that it would be an insuperable difficulty on my\\ntheory, unless it could likewise be shown that the species of this group\\nappeared suddenly and simultaneously throughout the world at this same\\nperiod.', \"It is almost superfluous to remark that hardly any fossil-fish\\nare known from south of the equator; and by running through Pictet's\\nPalaeontology it will be seen that very few species are known from\\nseveral formations in Europe.\", 'Some few families of fish now have a\\nconfined range; the teleostean fish might formerly have had a similarly\\nconfined range, and after having been largely developed in some one sea,\\nmight have spread widely.', 'Nor have we any right to suppose that the seas\\nof the world have always been so freely open from south to north as\\nthey are at present.', 'Even at this day, if the Malay Archipelago were\\nconverted into land, the tropical parts of the Indian Ocean would form\\na large and perfectly enclosed basin, in which any great group of marine\\nanimals might be multiplied; and here they would remain confined, until\\nsome of the species became adapted to a cooler climate, and were enabled\\nto double the southern capes of Africa or Australia, and thus reach\\nother and distant seas.', 'From these and similar considerations, but chiefly from our ignorance\\nof the geology of other countries beyond the confines of Europe and the\\nUnited States; and from the revolution in our palaeontological ideas\\non many points, which the discoveries of even the last dozen years have\\neffected, it seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on the\\nsuccession of organic beings throughout the world, as it would be for\\na naturalist to land for five minutes on some one barren point in\\nAustralia, and then to discuss the number and range of its productions.', 'ON THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF GROUPS OF ALLIED SPECIES IN THE LOWEST KNOWN\\nFOSSILIFEROUS STRATA.', 'There is another and allied difficulty, which is much graver.', 'I allude\\nto the manner in which numbers of species of the same group, suddenly\\nappear in the lowest known fossiliferous rocks.', 'Most of the arguments\\nwhich have convinced me that all the existing species of the same group\\nhave descended from one progenitor, apply with nearly equal force to\\nthe earliest known species.', 'For instance, I cannot doubt that all the\\nSilurian trilobites have descended from some one crustacean, which must\\nhave lived long before the Silurian age, and which probably differed\\ngreatly from any known animal.', 'Some of the most ancient Silurian\\nanimals, as the Nautilus, Lingula, etc., do not differ much from living\\nspecies; and it cannot on my theory be supposed, that these old species\\nwere the progenitors of all the species of the orders to which they\\nbelong, for they do not present characters in any degree intermediate\\nbetween them.', 'If, moreover, they had been the progenitors of these\\norders, they would almost certainly have been long ago supplanted and\\nexterminated by their numerous and improved descendants.', 'Consequently, if my theory be true, it is indisputable that before the\\nlowest Silurian stratum was deposited, long periods elapsed, as long as,\\nor probably far longer than, the whole interval from the Silurian age to\\nthe present day; and that during these vast, yet quite unknown, periods\\nof time, the world swarmed with living creatures.', 'To the question why we do not find records of these vast primordial\\nperiods, I can give no satisfactory answer.', 'Several of the most eminent\\ngeologists, with Sir R. Murchison at their head, are convinced that we\\nsee in the organic remains of the lowest Silurian stratum the dawn of\\nlife on this planet.', 'Other highly competent judges, as Lyell and the\\nlate E. Forbes, dispute this conclusion.', 'We should not forget that only\\na small portion of the world is known with accuracy.', 'M. Barrande has\\nlately added another and lower stage to the Silurian system, abounding\\nwith new and peculiar species.', \"Traces of life have been detected in the\\nLongmynd beds beneath Barrande's so-called primordial zone.\", 'The presence\\nof phosphatic nodules and bituminous matter in some of the lowest azoic\\nrocks, probably indicates the former existence of life at these periods.', 'But the difficulty of understanding the absence of vast piles of\\nfossiliferous strata, which on my theory no doubt were somewhere\\naccumulated before the Silurian epoch, is very great.', 'If these most\\nancient beds had been wholly worn away by denudation, or obliterated\\nby metamorphic action, we ought to find only small remnants of the\\nformations next succeeding them in age, and these ought to be very\\ngenerally in a metamorphosed condition.', 'But the descriptions which we\\nnow possess of the Silurian deposits over immense territories in\\nRussia and in North America, do not support the view, that the older a\\nformation is, the more it has suffered the extremity of denudation and\\nmetamorphism.', 'The case at present must remain inexplicable; and may be truly urged as\\na valid argument against the views here entertained.', 'To show that it\\nmay hereafter receive some explanation, I will give the following\\nhypothesis.', 'From the nature of the organic remains, which do not appear\\nto have inhabited profound depths, in the several formations of Europe\\nand of the United States; and from the amount of sediment, miles in\\nthickness, of which the formations are composed, we may infer that from\\nfirst to last large islands or tracts of land, whence the sediment was\\nderived, occurred in the neighbourhood of the existing continents of\\nEurope and North America.', 'But we do not know what was the state of\\nthings in the intervals between the successive formations; whether\\nEurope and the United States during these intervals existed as dry\\nland, or as a submarine surface near land, on which sediment was not\\ndeposited, or again as the bed of an open and unfathomable sea.', 'Looking to the existing oceans, which are thrice as extensive as the\\nland, we see them studded with many islands; but not one oceanic island\\nis as yet known to afford even a remnant of any palaeozoic or secondary\\nformation.', 'Hence we may perhaps infer, that during the palaeozoic and\\nsecondary periods, neither continents nor continental islands existed\\nwhere our oceans now extend; for had they existed there, palaeozoic and\\nsecondary formations would in all probability have been accumulated from\\nsediment derived from their wear and tear; and would have been at least\\npartially upheaved by the oscillations of level, which we may fairly\\nconclude must have intervened during these enormously long periods.', 'If\\nthen we may infer anything from these facts, we may infer that where\\nour oceans now extend, oceans have extended from the remotest period of\\nwhich we have any record; and on the other hand, that where continents\\nnow exist, large tracts of land have existed, subjected no doubt to\\ngreat oscillations of level, since the earliest silurian period.', 'The\\ncoloured map appended to my volume on Coral Reefs, led me to conclude\\nthat the great oceans are still mainly areas of subsidence, the great\\narchipelagoes still areas of oscillations of level, and the continents\\nareas of elevation.', 'But have we any right to assume that things have\\nthus remained from eternity?', 'Our continents seem to have been formed\\nby a preponderance, during many oscillations of level, of the force of\\nelevation; but may not the areas of preponderant movement have changed\\nin the lapse of ages?', 'At a period immeasurably antecedent to the\\nsilurian epoch, continents may have existed where oceans are now spread\\nout; and clear and open oceans may have existed where our continents now\\nstand.', 'Nor should we be justified in assuming that if, for instance, the\\nbed of the Pacific Ocean were now converted into a continent, we should\\nthere find formations older than the silurian strata, supposing such to\\nhave been formerly deposited; for it might well happen that strata which\\nhad subsided some miles nearer to the centre of the earth, and which\\nhad been pressed on by an enormous weight of superincumbent water, might\\nhave undergone far more metamorphic action than strata which have always\\nremained nearer to the surface.', 'The immense areas in some parts of the\\nworld, for instance in South America, of bare metamorphic rocks, which\\nmust have been heated under great pressure, have always seemed to me to\\nrequire some special explanation; and we may perhaps believe that we see\\nin these large areas, the many formations long anterior to the silurian\\nepoch in a completely metamorphosed condition.', 'The several difficulties here discussed, namely our not finding in the\\nsuccessive formations infinitely numerous transitional links between the\\nmany species which now exist or have existed; the sudden manner in which\\nwhole groups of species appear in our European formations; the almost\\nentire absence, as at present known, of fossiliferous formations beneath\\nthe Silurian strata, are all undoubtedly of the gravest nature.', 'We\\nsee this in the plainest manner by the fact that all the most eminent\\npalaeontologists, namely Cuvier, Owen, Agassiz, Barrande, Falconer,\\nE. Forbes, etc., and all our greatest geologists, as Lyell, Murchison,\\nSedgwick, etc., have unanimously, often vehemently, maintained the\\nimmutability of species.', 'But I have reason to believe that one great\\nauthority, Sir Charles Lyell, from further reflexion entertains grave\\ndoubts on this subject.', 'I feel how rash it is to differ from these great\\nauthorities, to whom, with others, we owe all our knowledge.', 'Those who\\nthink the natural geological record in any degree perfect, and who do\\nnot attach much weight to the facts and arguments of other kinds given\\nin this volume, will undoubtedly at once reject my theory.', \"For my part,\\nfollowing out Lyell's metaphor, I look at the natural geological record,\\nas a history of the world imperfectly kept, and written in a changing\\ndialect;

and every year tends to fill up the blanks between them, and to\\nmake the percentage system of lost and new forms more gradual.', 'In\\nsome of the most recent beds, though undoubtedly of high antiquity if\\nmeasured by years, only one or two species are lost forms, and only one\\nor two are new forms, having here appeared for the first time, either\\nlocally, or, as far as we know, on the face of the earth.', 'If we may\\ntrust the observations of Philippi in Sicily, the successive changes in\\nthe marine inhabitants of that island have been many and most gradual.', 'The secondary formations are more broken; but, as Bronn has remarked,\\nneither the appearance nor disappearance of their many now extinct\\nspecies has been simultaneous in each separate formation.', 'Species of different genera and classes have not changed at the same\\nrate, or in the same degree.', 'In the oldest tertiary beds a few living\\nshells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms.', 'Falconer has given a striking instance of a similar fact, in an existing\\ncrocodile associated with many strange and lost mammals and reptiles in\\nthe sub-Himalayan deposits.', 'The Silurian Lingula differs but little from\\nthe living species of this genus; whereas most of the other Silurian\\nMolluscs and all the Crustaceans have changed greatly.', 'The productions\\nof the land seem to change at a quicker rate than those of the sea, of\\nwhich a striking instance has lately been observed in Switzerland.', 'There\\nis some reason to believe that organisms, considered high in the scale\\nof nature, change more quickly than those that are low: though there\\nare exceptions to this rule.', 'The amount of organic change, as Pictet\\nhas remarked, does not strictly correspond with the succession of our\\ngeological formations; so that between each two consecutive formations,\\nthe forms of life have seldom changed in exactly the same degree.', 'Yet if\\nwe compare any but the most closely related formations, all the species\\nwill be found to have undergone some change.', 'When a species has once\\ndisappeared from the face of the earth, we have reason to believe\\nthat the same identical form never reappears.', 'The strongest apparent\\nexception to this latter rule, is that of the so-called \"colonies\" of M.\\nBarrande, which intrude for a period in the midst of an older formation,\\nand then allow the pre-existing fauna to reappear; but Lyell\\'s\\nexplanation, namely, that it is a case of temporary migration from a\\ndistinct geographical province, seems to me satisfactory.', 'These several facts accord well with my theory.', 'I believe in no fixed\\nlaw of development, causing all the inhabitants of a country to change\\nabruptly, or simultaneously, or to an equal degree.', 'The process of\\nmodification must be extremely slow.', 'The variability of each species\\nis quite independent of that of all others.', 'Whether such variability be\\ntaken advantage of by natural selection, and whether the variations be\\naccumulated to a greater or lesser amount, thus causing a greater or\\nlesser amount of modification in the varying species, depends on many\\ncomplex contingencies,--on the variability being of a beneficial nature,\\non the power of intercrossing, on the rate of breeding, on the slowly\\nchanging physical conditions of the country, and more especially on the\\nnature of the other inhabitants with which the varying species comes\\ninto competition.', 'Hence it is by no means surprising that one species\\nshould retain the same identical form much longer than others; or,\\nif changing, that it should change less.', 'We see the same fact in\\ngeographical distribution; for instance, in the land-shells and\\ncoleopterous insects of Madeira having come to differ considerably from\\ntheir nearest allies on the continent of Europe, whereas the marine\\nshells and birds have remained unaltered.', 'We can perhaps understand\\nthe apparently quicker rate of change in terrestrial and in more highly\\norganised productions compared with marine and lower productions, by\\nthe more complex relations of the higher beings to their organic and\\ninorganic conditions of life, as explained in a former chapter.', 'When\\nmany of the inhabitants of a country have become modified and improved,\\nwe can understand, on the principle of competition, and on that of the\\nmany all-important relations of organism to organism, that any form\\nwhich does not become in some degree modified and improved, will be\\nliable to be exterminated.', 'Hence we can see why all the species in the\\nsame region do at last, if we look to wide enough intervals of time,\\nbecome modified; for those which do not change will become extinct.', 'In members of the same class the average amount of change, during long\\nand equal periods of time, may, perhaps, be nearly the same; but as the\\naccumulation of long-enduring fossiliferous formations depends on great\\nmasses of sediment having been deposited on areas whilst subsiding,\\nour formations have been almost necessarily accumulated at wide and\\nirregularly intermittent intervals; consequently the amount of organic\\nchange exhibited by the fossils embedded in consecutive formations\\nis not equal.', 'Each formation, on this view, does not mark a new and\\ncomplete act of creation, but only an occasional scene, taken almost at\\nhazard, in a slowly changing drama.', 'We can clearly understand why a species when once lost should never\\nreappear, even if the very same conditions of life, organic and\\ninorganic, should recur.', 'For though the offspring of one species might\\nbe adapted (and no doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances) to\\nfill the exact place of another species in the economy of nature, and\\nthus supplant it; yet the two forms--the old and the new--would not be\\nidentically the same; for both would almost certainly inherit different\\ncharacters from their distinct progenitors.', 'For instance, it is just\\npossible, if our fantail-pigeons were all destroyed, that fanciers, by\\nstriving during long ages for the same object, might make a new breed\\nhardly distinguishable from our present fantail; but if the parent\\nrock-pigeon were also destroyed, and in nature we have every reason\\nto believe that the parent-form will generally be supplanted and\\nexterminated by its improved offspring, it is quite incredible that a\\nfantail, identical with the existing breed, could be raised from any\\nother species of pigeon, or even from the other well-established races\\nof the domestic pigeon, for the newly-formed fantail would be almost\\nsure to inherit from its new progenitor some slight characteristic\\ndifferences.', 'Groups of species, that is, genera and families, follow the same general\\nrules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species,\\nchanging more or less quickly, and in a greater or lesser degree.', 'A\\ngroup does not reappear after it has once disappeared; or its existence,\\nas long as it lasts, is continuous.', 'I am aware that there are some\\napparent exceptions to this rule, but the exceptions are surprisingly\\nfew, so few, that E. Forbes, Pictet, and Woodward (though all strongly\\nopposed to such views as I maintain) admit its truth; and the rule\\nstrictly accords with my theory.', 'For as all the species of the same\\ngroup have descended from some one species, it is clear that as long as\\nany species of the group have appeared in the long succession of ages,\\nso long must its members have continuously existed, in order to have\\ngenerated either new and modified or the same old and unmodified forms.', 'Species of the genus Lingula, for instance, must have continuously\\nexisted by an unbroken succession of generations, from the lowest\\nSilurian stratum to the present day.', 'We have seen in the last chapter that the species of a group sometimes\\nfalsely appear to have come in abruptly; and I have attempted to give\\nan explanation of this fact, which if true would have been fatal to my\\nviews.', 'But such cases are certainly exceptional; the general rule being\\na gradual increase in number, till the group reaches its maximum, and\\nthen, sooner or later, it gradually decreases.', 'If the number of\\nthe species of a genus, or the number of the genera of a family, be\\nrepresented by a vertical line of varying thickness, crossing the\\nsuccessive geological formations in which the species are found, the\\nline will sometimes falsely appear to begin at its lower end, not in a\\nsharp point, but abruptly; it then gradually thickens upwards, sometimes\\nkeeping for a space of equal thickness, and ultimately thins out in the\\nupper beds, marking the decrease and final extinction of the species.', 'This gradual increase in number of the species of a group is strictly\\nconformable with my theory; as the species of the same genus, and the\\ngenera of the same family, can increase only slowly and progressively;\\nfor the process of modification and the production of a number of allied\\nforms must be slow and gradual,--one species giving rise first to two\\nor three varieties, these being slowly converted into species, which in\\ntheir turn produce by equally slow steps other species, and so on, like\\nthe branching of a great tree from a single stem, till the group becomes\\nlarge.', 'ON EXTINCTION.', 'We have as yet spoken only incidentally of the disappearance of species\\nand of groups of species.', 'On the theory of natural selection the\\nextinction of old forms and the production of new and improved forms are\\nintimately connected together.', 'The old notion of all the inhabitants of\\nthe earth having been swept away at successive periods by catastrophes,\\nis very generally given up, even by those geologists, as Elie de\\nBeaumont, Murchison, Barrande, etc., whose general views would naturally\\nlead them to this conclusion.', 'On the contrary, we have every reason to\\nbelieve, from the study of the tertiary formations, that species and\\ngroups of species gradually disappear, one after another, first from one\\nspot, then from another, and finally from the world.', 'Both single species\\nand whole groups of species last for very unequal periods; some groups,\\nas we have seen, having endured from the earliest known dawn of life\\nto the present day; some having disappeared before the close of the\\npalaeozoic period.', 'No fixed law seems to determine the length of time\\nduring which any single species or any single genus endures.', 'There is\\nreason to believe that the complete extinction of the species of a group\\nis generally a slower process than their production: if the appearance\\nand disappearance of a group of species be represented, as before, by\\na vertical line of varying thickness, the line is found to taper more\\ngradually at its upper end, which marks the progress of extermination,\\nthan at its lower end, which marks the first appearance and increase\\nin numbers of the species.', 'In some cases, however, the extermination\\nof whole groups of beings, as of ammonites towards the close of the\\nsecondary period, has been wonderfully sudden.', 'The whole subject of the extinction of species has been involved in the\\nmost gratuitous mystery.', 'Some authors have even supposed that as the\\nindividual has a definite length of life, so have species a definite\\nduration.', 'No one I think can have marvelled more at the extinction of\\nspecies, than I have done.', 'When I found in La Plata the tooth of a horse\\nembedded with the remains of Mastodon, Megatherium, Toxodon, and other\\nextinct monsters, which all co-existed with still living shells at a\\nvery late geological period, I was filled with astonishment; for seeing\\nthat the horse, since its introduction by the Spaniards into South\\nAmerica, has run wild over the whole country and has increased in\\nnumbers at an unparalleled rate, I asked myself what could so recently\\nhave exterminated the former horse under conditions of life apparently\\nso favourable.', 'But how utterly groundless was my astonishment!', 'Professor\\nOwen soon perceived that the tooth, though so like that of the existing\\nhorse, belonged to an extinct species.', 'Had this horse been still\\nliving, but in some degree rare, no naturalist would have felt the least\\nsurprise at its rarity; for rarity is the attribute of a vast number of\\nspecies of all classes, in all countries.', 'If we ask ourselves why this\\nor that species is rare, we answer that something is unfavourable in its\\nconditions of life; but what that something is, we can hardly ever tell.', 'On the supposition of the fossil horse still existing as a rare species,\\nwe might have felt certain from the analogy of all other mammals,\\neven of the slow-breeding elephant, and from the history of the\\nnaturalisation of the domestic horse in South America, that under more\\nfavourable conditions it would in a very few years have stocked the\\nwhole continent.', \"But we could not have told what the unfavourable\\nconditions were which checked its increase, whether some one or several\\ncontingencies, and at what period of the horse's life, and in what\\ndegree, they severally acted.\", 'If the conditions had gone on, however\\nslowly, becoming less and less favourable, we assuredly should not have\\nperceived the fact, yet the fossil horse would certainly have become\\nrarer and rarer, and finally extinct;--its place being seized on by some\\nmore successful competitor.', 'It is most difficult always to remember that the increase of every\\nliving being is constantly being checked by unperceived injurious\\nagencies; and that these same unperceived agencies are amply sufficient\\nto cause rarity, and finally extinction.', \"We see in many cases in the\\nmore recent tertiary formations, that rarity precedes extinction; and we\\nknow that this has been the progress of events with those animals which\\nhave been exterminated, either locally or wholly, through man's agency.\", 'I may repeat what I published in 1845, namely, that to admit that\\nspecies generally become rare before they become extinct--to feel no\\nsurprise at the rarity of a species, and yet to marvel greatly when\\nit ceases to exist, is much the same as to admit that sickness in the\\nindividual is the forerunner of death--to feel no surprise at sickness,\\nbut when the sick man dies, to wonder and to suspect that he died by\\nsome unknown deed of violence.', 'The theory of natural selection is grounded on the belief that each new\\nvariety, and ultimately each new species, is produced and maintained by\\nhaving some advantage over those with which it comes into competition;\\nand the consequent extinction of less-favoured forms almost inevitably\\nfollows.', 'It is the same with our domestic productions: when a new and\\nslightly improved variety has been raised, it at first supplants the\\nless improved varieties in the same neighbourhood; when much improved it\\nis transported far and near, like our short-horn cattle, and takes the\\nplace of other breeds in other countries.', 'Thus the appearance of new\\nforms and the disappearance of old forms, both natural and artificial,\\nare bound together.', 'In certain flourishing groups, the number of new\\nspecific forms which have been produced within a given time is probably\\ngreater than that of the old forms which have been exterminated; but we\\nknow that the number of species has not gone on indefinitely increasing,\\nat least during the later geological periods, so that looking to later\\ntimes we may believe that the production of new forms has caused the\\nextinction of about the same number of old forms.', 'The competition will generally be most severe, as formerly explained\\nand illustrated by examples, between the forms which are most like each\\nother in all respects.', 'Hence the improved and modified descendants of\\na species will generally cause the extermination of the parent-species;\\nand if many new forms have been developed from any one species, the\\nnearest allies of that species, i.e.', 'the species of the same genus, will\\nbe the most liable to extermination.', 'Thus, as I believe, a number of\\nnew species descended from one species, that is a new genus, comes to\\nsupplant an old genus, belonging to the same family.', 'But it must often\\nhave happened that a new species belonging to some one group will have\\nseized on the place occupied by a species belonging to a distinct group,\\nand thus caused its extermination; and if many allied forms be developed\\nfrom the successful intruder, many will have to yield their places; and\\nit will generally be allied forms, which will suffer from some inherited\\ninferiority in common.', 'But whether it be species belonging to the same\\nor to a distinct class, which yield their places to other species which\\nhave been modified and improved, a few of the sufferers may often long\\nbe preserved, from being fitted to some peculiar line of life, or from\\ninhabiting some distant and isolated station, where they have escaped\\nsevere competition.', 'For instance, a single species of Trigonia, a great\\ngenus of shells in the secondary formations, survives in the Australian\\nseas; and a few members of the great and almost extinct group of Ganoid\\nfishes still inhabit our fresh waters.', 'Therefore the utter extinction\\nof a group is generally, as we have seen, a slower process than its\\nproduction.', 'With respect to the apparently sudden extermination of whole families\\nor orders, as of Trilobites at the close of the palaeozoic period and\\nof Ammonites at the close of the secondary period, we must remember what\\nhas been already said on the probable wide intervals of time between our\\nconsecutive formations; and in these intervals there may have been much\\nslow extermination.', 'Moreover, when by sudden immigration or by unusually\\nrapid development, many species of a new group have taken possession\\nof a new area, they will have exterminated in a correspondingly rapid\\nmanner many of the old inhabitants; and the forms which thus yield\\ntheir places will commonly be allied, for they will partake of some\\ninferiority in common.', 'Thus, as it seems to me, the manner in which single species and whole\\ngroups of species become extinct, accords well with the theory of\\nnatural selection.', 'We need not marvel at extinction; if we must\\nmarvel, let it be at our presumption in imagining for a moment that we\\nunderstand the many complex contingencies, on which the existence of\\neach species depends.', 'If we forget for an instant, that each species\\ntends to increase inordinately, and that some check is always in action,\\nyet seldom perceived by us, the whole economy of nature will be utterly\\nobscured.', 'Whenever we can precisely say why this species is more\\nabundant in individuals than that; why this species and not another\\ncan be naturalised in a given country; then, and not till then, we may\\njustly feel surprise why we cannot account for the extinction of this\\nparticular species or group of species.', 'ON THE FORMS OF LIFE CHANGING ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE\\nWORLD.', 'Scarcely any palaeontological discovery is more striking than the fact,\\nthat the forms of life change almost simultaneously throughout the\\nworld.', 'Thus our European Chalk formation can be recognised in many\\ndistant parts of the world, under the most different climates, where not\\na fragment of the mineral chalk itself can be found; namely, in North\\nAmerica, in equatorial South America, in Tierra del Fuego, at the\\nCape of Good Hope, and in the peninsula of India.', 'For at these distant\\npoints, the organic remains in certain beds present an unmistakeable\\ndegree of resemblance to those of the Chalk.', 'It is not that the same\\nspecies are met with; for in some cases not one species is identically\\nthe same, but they belong to the same families, genera, and sections\\nof genera, and sometimes are similarly characterised in such trifling\\npoints as mere superficial sculpture.', 'Moreover other forms, which are\\nnot found in the Chalk of Europe, but which occur in the formations\\neither above or below, are similarly absent at these distant points of\\nthe world.', 'In the several successive palaeozoic formations of Russia,\\nWestern Europe and North America, a similar parallelism in the forms of\\nlife has been observed by several authors: so it is, according to Lyell,\\nwith the several European and North American tertiary deposits.', 'Even\\nif the few fossil species which are common to the Old and New Worlds be\\nkept wholly out of view, the general parallelism in the successive forms\\nof life, in the stages of the widely separated palaeozoic and tertiary\\nperiods, would still be manifest, and the several formations could be\\neasily correlated.', 'These observations, however, relate to the marine inhabitants of distant\\nparts of the world: we have not sufficient data to judge whether the\\nproductions of the land and of fresh water change at distant points in\\nthe same parallel manner.', 'We may doubt whether they have thus changed:\\nif the Megatherium, Mylodon, Macrauchenia, and Toxodon had been brought\\nto Europe from La Plata, without any information in regard to their\\ngeological position, no one would have suspected that they had coexisted\\nwith still living sea-shells; but as these anomalous monsters coexisted\\nwith the Mastodon and Horse, it might at least have been inferred that\\nthey had lived during one of the latter tertiary stages.', 'When the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changed\\nsimultaneously throughout the world, it must not be supposed that this\\nexpression relates to the same thousandth or hundred-thousandth year, or\\neven that it has a very strict geological sense; for if all the marine\\nanimals which live at the present day in Europe, and all those that\\nlived in Europe during the pleistocene period (an enormously remote\\nperiod as measured by years, including the whole glacial epoch), were to\\nbe compared with those now living in South America or in Australia, the\\nmost skilful naturalist would hardly be able to say whether the existing\\nor the pleistocene inhabitants of Europe resembled most closely those of\\nthe southern hemisphere.', 'So, again, several highly competent observers\\nbelieve that the existing productions of the United States are more\\nclosely related to those which lived in Europe during certain later\\ntertiary stages, than to those which now live here; and if this be so,\\nit is evident that fossiliferous beds deposited at the present day on\\nthe shores of North America would hereafter be liable to be classed with\\nsomewhat older European beds.', 'Nevertheless, looking to a remotely future\\nepoch, there can, I think, be little doubt that all the more modern\\nMARINE formations, namely, the upper pliocene, the pleistocene and\\nstrictly modern beds, of Europe, North and South America, and Australia,\\nfrom containing fossil remains in some degree allied, and from not\\nincluding those forms which are only found in the older underlying\\ndeposits, would be correctly ranked as simultaneous in a geological\\nsense.', 'The fact of the forms of life changing simultaneously, in the above\\nlarge sense, at distant parts of the world, has greatly struck those\\nadmirable observers, MM.', \"de Verneuil and d'Archiac.\", 'After referring\\nto the parallelism of the palaeozoic forms of life in various parts\\nof Europe, they add, \"If struck by this strange sequence, we turn our\\nattention to North America, and there discover a series of analogous\\nphenomena, it will appear certain that all these modifications of\\nspecies, their extinction, and the introduction of new ones, cannot be\\nowing to mere changes in marine currents or other causes more or less\\nlocal and temporary, but depend on general laws which govern the whole\\nanimal kingdom.\"', 'M. Barrande has made forcible remarks to precisely the\\nsame effect.', 'It is, indeed, quite futile to look to changes of currents,\\nclimate, or other physical conditions, as the cause of these great\\nmutations in the forms of life throughout the world, under the most\\ndifferent climates.', 'We must, as Barrande has remarked, look to some\\nspecial law.', 'We shall see this more clearly when we treat of the present\\ndistribution of organic beings, and find how slight is the relation\\nbetween the physical conditions of various countries, and the nature of\\ntheir inhabitants.', 'This great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of life\\nthroughout the world, is explicable on the theory of natural selection.', 'New species are formed by new varieties arising, which have some\\nadvantage over older forms; and those forms, which are already dominant,\\nor have some advantage over the other forms in their own country, would\\nnaturally oftenest give rise to new varieties or incipient species; for\\nthese latter must be victorious in a still higher degree in order to be\\npreserved and to survive.', 'We have distinct evidence on this head, in\\nthe plants which are dominant, that is, which are commonest in their own\\nhomes, and are most widely diffused, having produced the greatest number\\nof new varieties.', 'It is also natural that the dominant, varying, and\\nfar-spreading species, which already have invaded to a certain extent\\nthe territories of other species, should be those which would have\\nthe best chance of spreading still further, and of giving rise in new\\ncountries to new varieties and species.', 'The process of diffusion\\nmay often be very slow, being dependent on climatal and geographical\\nchanges, or on strange accidents, but in the long run the dominant\\nforms will generally succeed in spreading.', 'The diffusion would, it\\nis probable, be slower with the terrestrial inhabitants of distinct\\ncontinents than with the marine inhabitants of the continuous sea.', 'We\\nmight therefore expect to find, as we apparently do find, a less strict\\ndegree of parallel succession in the productions of the land than of the\\nsea.', 'Dominant species spreading from any region might encounter still more\\ndominant species, and then their triumphant course, or even their\\nexistence, would cease.', 'We know not at all precisely what are all the\\nconditions most favourable for the multiplication of new and dominant\\nspecies; but we can, I think, clearly see that a number of individuals,\\nfrom giving a better chance of the appearance of favourable variations,\\nand that severe competition with many already existing forms, would\\nbe highly favourable, as would be the power of spreading into new\\nterritories.', 'A certain amount of isolation, recurring at long intervals\\nof time, would probably be also favourable, as before explained.', 'One\\nquarter of the world may have been most favourable for the production\\nof new and dominant species on the land, and another for those in the\\nwaters of the sea.', 'If two great regions had been for a long period\\nfavourably circumstanced in an equal degree, whenever their inhabitants\\nmet, the battle would be prolonged and severe; and some from one\\nbirthplace and some from the other might be victorious.', 'But in the\\ncourse of time, the forms dominant in the highest degree, wherever\\nproduced, would tend everywhere to prevail.', 'As they prevailed, they\\nwould cause the extinction of other and inferior forms; and as these\\ninferior forms would be allied in groups by inheritance, whole groups\\nwould tend slowly to disappear; though here and there a single member\\nmight long be enabled to survive.', 'Thus, as it seems to me, the parallel, and, taken in a large sense,\\nsimultaneous, succession of the same forms of life throughout the world,\\naccords well with the principle of new species having been formed by\\ndominant species spreading widely and varying; the new species thus\\nproduced being themselves dominant owing to inheritance, and to having\\nalready had some advantage over their parents or over other species;\\nthese again spreading, varying, and producing new species.', 'The forms\\nwhich are beaten and which yield their places to the new and victorious\\nforms, will generally be allied in groups, from inheriting some\\ninferiority in common; and therefore as new and improved groups spread\\nthroughout the world, old groups will disappear from the world; and the\\nsuccession of forms in both ways will everywhere tend to correspond.', 'There is one other remark connected with this subject worth making.', 'I\\nhave given my reasons for believing that all our greater fossiliferous\\nformations were deposited during periods of subsidence; and that blank\\nintervals of vast duration occurred during the periods when the bed of\\nthe sea was either stationary or rising, and likewise when sediment was\\nnot thrown down quickly enough to embed and preserve organic remains.', 'During these long and blank intervals I suppose that the inhabitants\\nof each region underwent a considerable amount of modification and\\nextinction, and that there was much migration from other parts of the\\nworld.', 'As we have reason to believe that large areas are affected by the\\nsame movement, it is probable that strictly contemporaneous formations\\nhave often been accumulated over very wide spaces in the same quarter\\nof the world; but we are far from having any right to conclude that this\\nhas invariably been the case, and that large areas have invariably been\\naffected by the same movements.', 'When two formations have been deposited\\nin two regions during nearly, but not exactly the same period, we should\\nfind in both, from the causes explained in the foregoing paragraphs, the\\nsame general succession in the forms of life; but the species would not\\nexactly correspond; for there will have been a little more time in\\nthe one region than in the other for modification, extinction, and\\nimmigration.', 'I suspect that cases of this nature have occurred in Europe.', 'Mr.\\nPrestwich, in his admirable Memoirs on the eocene deposits of England\\nand France, is able to draw a close general parallelism between the\\nsuccessive stages in the two countries; but when he compares certain\\nstages in England with those in France, although he finds in both a\\ncurious accordance in the numbers of the species belonging to the same\\ngenera, yet the species themselves differ in a manner very difficult\\nto account for, considering the proximity of the two areas,--unless,\\nindeed, it be assumed that an isthmus separated two seas inhabited\\nby distinct, but contemporaneous, faunas.', 'Lyell has made similar\\nobservations on some of the later tertiary formations.', 'Barrande, also,\\nshows that there is a striking general parallelism in the successive\\nSilurian deposits of Bohemia and Scandinavia; nevertheless he finds\\na surprising amount of difference in the species.', 'If the several\\nformations in these regions have not been deposited during the same\\nexact periods,--a formation in one region often corresponding with a\\nblank interval in the other,--and if in both regions the species\\nhave gone on slowly changing during the accumulation of the several\\nformations and during the long intervals of time between them; in this\\ncase, the several formations in the two regions could be arranged in\\nthe same order, in accordance with the general succession of the form\\nof life, and the order would falsely appear to be strictly parallel;\\nnevertheless the species would not all be the same in the apparently\\ncorresponding stages in the two regions.', 'ON THE AFFINITIES OF EXTINCT SPECIES TO EACH OTHER, AND TO LIVING FORMS.', 'Let us now look to the mutual affinities of extinct and living species.', 'They all fall into one grand natural system; and this fact is at once\\nexplained on the principle of descent.', 'The more ancient any form is, the\\nmore, as a general rule, it differs from living forms.', 'But, as Buckland\\nlong ago remarked, all fossils can be classed either in still existing\\ngroups, or between them.', 'That the extinct forms of life help to fill up\\nthe wide intervals between existing genera, families, and orders, cannot\\nbe disputed.', 'For if we confine our attention either to the living or\\nto the extinct alone, the series is far less perfect than if we combine\\nboth into one general system.', 'With respect to the Vertebrata, whole\\npages could be filled with striking illustrations from our great\\npalaeontologist, Owen, showing how extinct animals fall in between\\nexisting groups.', 'Cuvier ranked the Ruminants and Pachyderms, as the two\\nmost distinct orders of mammals; but Owen has discovered so many fossil\\nlinks, that he has had to alter the whole classification of these two\\norders; and has placed certain pachyderms in the same sub-order with\\nruminants: for example, he dissolves by fine gradations the apparently\\nwide difference between the pig and the camel.', 'In regard to the\\nInvertebrata, Barrande, and a higher authority could not be named,\\nasserts that he is every day taught that palaeozoic animals, though\\nbelonging to the same orders, families, or genera with those living at\\nthe present day, were not at this early epoch limited in such distinct\\ngroups as they now are.', 'Some writers have objected to any extinct species or group of species\\nbeing considered as intermediate between living species or groups.', 'If by\\nthis term it is meant that an extinct form is directly intermediate in\\nall its characters between two living forms, the objection is probably\\nvalid.', 'But I apprehend that in a perfectly natural classification many\\nfossil species would have to stand between living species, and some\\nextinct genera between living genera, even between genera belonging to\\ndistinct families.', 'The most common case, especially with respect to very\\ndistinct groups, such as fish and reptiles, seems to be, that supposing\\nthem to be distinguished at the present day from each other by a\\ndozen characters, the ancient members of the same two groups would be\\ndistinguished by a somewhat lesser number of characters, so that the two\\ngroups, though formerly quite distinct, at that period made some small\\napproach to each other.', 'It is a common belief that the more ancient a form is, by so much the\\nmore it tends to connect by some of its characters groups now widely\\nseparated from each other.', 'This remark no doubt must be restricted\\nto those groups which have undergone much change in the course of\\ngeological ages; and it would be difficult to prove the truth of\\nthe proposition, for every now and then even a living animal, as the\\nLepidosiren, is discovered having affinities directed towards very\\ndistinct groups.', 'Yet if we compare the older Reptiles and Batrachians,\\nthe older Fish, the older Cephalopods, and the eocene Mammals, with the\\nmore recent members of the same classes, we must admit that there is\\nsome truth in the remark.', 'Let us see how far these several facts and inferences accord with the\\ntheory of descent with modification.', 'As the subject is somewhat complex,\\nI must request the reader to turn to the diagram in the fourth chapter.', 'We may suppose that the numbered letters represent genera, and the\\ndotted lines diverging from them the species in each genus.', 'The diagram\\nis much too simple, too few genera and too few species being given,\\nbut this is unimportant for us.', 'The horizontal lines may represent\\nsuccessive geological formations, and all the forms beneath the\\nuppermost line may be considered as extinct.', 'The three existing genera,\\na14, q14, p14, will form a small family; b14 and f14 a closely allied\\nfamily or sub-family; and o14, e14, m14, a third family.', 'These three\\nfamilies, together with the many extinct genera on the several lines of\\ndescent diverging from the parent-form A, will form an order; for all\\nwill have inherited something in common from their ancient and common\\nprogenitor.', 'On the principle of the continued tendency to divergence\\nof character, which was formerly illustrated by this diagram, the more\\nrecent any form is, the more it will generally differ from its ancient\\nprogenitor.', 'Hence we can understand the rule that the most ancient\\nfossils differ most from existing forms.', 'We must not, however, assume\\nthat divergence of character is a necessary contingency; it depends\\nsolely on the descendants from a species being thus enabled to seize\\non many and different places in the economy of nature.', 'Therefore it is\\nquite possible, as we have seen in the case of some Silurian forms,\\nthat a species might go on being slightly modified in relation to its\\nslightly altered conditions of life, and yet retain throughout a vast\\nperiod the same general characteristics.', 'This is represented in the\\ndiagram by the letter F14.', 'All the many forms, extinct and recent, descended from A, make, as\\nbefore remarked, one order; and this order, from the continued effects\\nof extinction and divergence of character, has become divided into\\nseveral sub-families and families, some of which are supposed to have\\nperished at different periods, and some to have endured to the present\\nday.', 'By looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct forms,\\nsupposed to be embedded in the successive formations, were discovered\\nat several points low down in the series, the three existing families on\\nthe uppermost line would be rendered less distinct from each other.', 'If,\\nfor instance, the genera a1, a5, a10, f8, m3, m6, m9 were disinterred,\\nthese three families would be so closely linked together that they\\nprobably would have to be united into one great family, in nearly the\\nsame manner as has occurred with ruminants and pachyderms.', 'Yet he who\\nobjected to call the extinct genera, which thus linked the living\\ngenera of three families together, intermediate in character, would be\\njustified, as they are intermediate, not directly, but only by a long\\nand circuitous course through many widely different forms.', 'If many\\nextinct forms were to be discovered above one of the middle horizontal\\nlines or geological formations--for instance, above Number VI.--but\\nnone from beneath this line, then only the two families on the left\\nhand (namely, a14, etc., and b14, etc.)', 'would have to be united into\\none family; and the two other families (namely, a14 to f14 now including\\nfive genera, and o14 to m14) would yet remain distinct.', 'These two\\nfamilies, however, would be less distinct from each other than they were\\nbefore the discovery of the fossils.', 'If, for instance, we suppose the\\nexisting genera of the two families to differ from each other by a dozen\\ncharacters, in this case the genera, at the early period marked VI.,\\nwould differ by a lesser number of characters; for at this early\\nstage of descent they have not diverged in character from the common\\nprogenitor of the order, nearly so much as they subsequently diverged.', 'Thus it comes that ancient and extinct genera are often in some slight\\ndegree intermediate in character between their modified descendants, or\\nbetween their collateral relations.', 'In nature the case will be far more complicated than is represented in\\nthe diagram; for the groups will have been more numerous, they will\\nhave endured for extremely unequal lengths of time, and will have been\\nmodified in various degrees.', 'As we possess only the last volume of the\\ngeological record, and that in a very broken condition, we have no right\\nto expect, except in very rare cases, to fill up wide intervals in the\\nnatural system, and thus unite distinct families or orders.', 'All that we\\nhave a right to expect, is that those groups, which have within known\\ngeological periods undergone much modification, should in the older\\nformations make some slight approach to each other; so that the older\\nmembers should differ less from each other in some of their characters\\nthan do the existing members of the same groups; and this by the\\nconcurrent evidence of our best palaeontologists seems frequently to be\\nthe case.', 'Thus, on the theory of descent with modification, the main facts with\\nrespect to the mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life to each\\nother and to living forms, seem to me explained in a satisfactory\\nmanner.', 'And they are wholly inexplicable on any other view.', \"On this same theory, it is evident that the fauna of any great period\\nin the earth's history will be intermediate in general character between\\nthat which preceded and that which succeeded it.\", 'Thus, the species\\nwhich lived at the sixth great stage of descent in the diagram are the\\nmodified offspring of those which lived at the fifth stage, and are the\\nparents of those which became still more modified at the seventh stage;\\nhence they could hardly fail to be nearly intermediate in character\\nbetween the forms of life above and below.', 'We must, however, allow for\\nthe entire extinction of some preceding forms, and for the coming in of\\nquite new forms by immigration, and for a large amount of modification,\\nduring the long and blank intervals between the successive formations.', 'Subject to these allowances, the fauna of each geological period\\nundoubtedly is intermediate in character, between the preceding and\\nsucceeding faunas.', 'I need give only one instance, namely, the manner\\nin which the fossils of the Devonian system, when this system was first\\ndiscovered, were at once recognised by palaeontologists as intermediate\\nin character between those of the overlying carboniferous, and\\nunderlying Silurian system.', 'But each fauna is not necessarily exactly\\nintermediate, as unequal intervals of time have elapsed between\\nconsecutive formations.', 'It is no real objection to the truth of the statement, that the fauna of\\neach period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character between the\\npreceding and succeeding faunas, that certain genera offer exceptions\\nto the rule.', 'For instance, mastodons and elephants, when arranged by Dr.\\nFalconer in two series, first according to their mutual affinities\\nand then according to their periods of existence, do not accord in\\narrangement.', 'The species extreme in character are not the oldest, or\\nthe most recent; nor are those which are intermediate in character,\\nintermediate in age.', 'But supposing for an instant, in this and other\\nsuch cases, that the record of the first appearance and disappearance\\nof the species was perfect, we have no reason to believe that forms\\nsuccessively produced necessarily endure for corresponding lengths of\\ntime: a very ancient form might occasionally last much longer than\\na form elsewhere subsequently produced, especially in the case of\\nterrestrial productions inhabiting separated districts.', 'To compare small\\nthings with great: if the principal living and extinct races of the\\ndomestic pigeon were arranged as well as they could be in serial\\naffinity, this arrangement would not closely accord with the order\\nin time of their production, and still less with the order of their\\ndisappearance;

that only a small portion of the globe has been geologically\\nexplored with care; that only certain classes of organic beings have\\nbeen largely preserved in a fossil state; that the number both of\\nspecimens and of species, preserved in our museums, is absolutely as\\nnothing compared with the incalculable number of generations which\\nmust have passed away even during a single formation; that, owing\\nto subsidence being necessary for the accumulation of fossiliferous\\ndeposits thick enough to resist future degradation, enormous intervals\\nof time have elapsed between the successive formations; that there has\\nprobably been more extinction during the periods of subsidence, and more\\nvariation during the periods of elevation, and during the latter the\\nrecord will have been least perfectly kept; that each single formation\\nhas not been continuously deposited; that the duration of each formation\\nis, perhaps, short compared with the average duration of specific forms;\\nthat migration has played an important part in the first appearance of\\nnew forms in any one area and formation; that widely ranging species\\nare those which have varied most, and have oftenest given rise to new\\nspecies; and that varieties have at first often been local.', 'All these\\ncauses taken conjointly, must have tended to make the geological record\\nextremely imperfect, and will to a large extent explain why we do not\\nfind interminable varieties, connecting together all the extinct and\\nexisting forms of life by the finest graduated steps.', 'He who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record, will\\nrightly reject my whole theory.', 'For he may ask in vain where are the\\nnumberless transitional links which must formerly have connected the\\nclosely allied or representative species, found in the several stages of\\nthe same great formation.', 'He may disbelieve in the enormous intervals\\nof time which have elapsed between our consecutive formations; he may\\noverlook how important a part migration must have played, when the\\nformations of any one great region alone, as that of Europe, are\\nconsidered; he may urge the apparent, but often falsely apparent, sudden\\ncoming in of whole groups of species.', 'He may ask where are the remains\\nof those infinitely numerous organisms which must have existed long\\nbefore the first bed of the Silurian system was deposited: I can answer\\nthis latter question only hypothetically, by saying that as far as we\\ncan see, where our oceans now extend they have for an enormous period\\nextended, and where our oscillating continents now stand they have stood\\never since the Silurian epoch; but that long before that period, the\\nworld may have presented a wholly different aspect; and that the older\\ncontinents, formed of formations older than any known to us, may now all\\nbe in a metamorphosed condition, or may lie buried under the ocean.', 'Passing from these difficulties, all the other great leading facts in\\npalaeontology seem to me simply to follow on the theory of descent with\\nmodification through natural selection.', 'We can thus understand how it\\nis that new species come in slowly and successively; how species of\\ndifferent classes do not necessarily change together, or at the same\\nrate, or in the same degree; yet in the long run that all undergo\\nmodification to some extent.', 'The extinction of old forms is the almost\\ninevitable consequence of the production of new forms.', 'We can understand\\nwhy when a species has once disappeared it never reappears.', 'Groups of\\nspecies increase in numbers slowly, and endure for unequal periods of\\ntime; for the process of modification is necessarily slow, and depends\\non many complex contingencies.', 'The dominant species of the larger\\ndominant groups tend to leave many modified descendants, and thus new\\nsub-groups and groups are formed.', 'As these are formed, the species of\\nthe less vigorous groups, from their inferiority inherited from a common\\nprogenitor, tend to become extinct together, and to leave no modified\\noffspring on the face of the earth.', 'But the utter extinction of a whole\\ngroup of species may often be a very slow process, from the survival of\\na few descendants, lingering in protected and isolated situations.', 'When\\na group has once wholly disappeared, it does not reappear; for the link\\nof generation has been broken.', 'We can understand how the spreading of the dominant forms of life, which\\nare those that oftenest vary, will in the long run tend to people the\\nworld with allied, but modified, descendants; and these will generally\\nsucceed in taking the places of those groups of species which are their\\ninferiors in the struggle for existence.', 'Hence, after long intervals\\nof time, the productions of the world will appear to have changed\\nsimultaneously.', 'We can understand how it is that all the forms of life, ancient and\\nrecent, make together one grand system;

as does time for the slow process of modification\\nthrough natural selection.', 'Widely-ranging species, abounding in\\nindividuals, which have already triumphed over many competitors in their\\nown widely-extended homes will have the best chance of seizing on new\\nplaces, when they spread into new countries.', 'In their new homes they\\nwill be exposed to new conditions, and will frequently undergo further\\nmodification and improvement; and thus they will become still further\\nvictorious, and will produce groups of modified descendants.', 'On this\\nprinciple of inheritance with modification, we can understand how it is\\nthat sections of genera, whole genera, and even families are confined to\\nthe same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case.', 'I believe, as was remarked in the last chapter, in no law of necessary\\ndevelopment.', 'As the variability of each species is an independent\\nproperty, and will be taken advantage of by natural selection, only so\\nfar as it profits the individual in its complex struggle for life,\\nso the degree of modification in different species will be no uniform\\nquantity.', 'If, for instance, a number of species, which stand in direct\\ncompetition with each other, migrate in a body into a new and afterwards\\nisolated country, they will be little liable to modification; for\\nneither migration nor isolation in themselves can do anything.', 'These\\nprinciples come into play only by bringing organisms into new relations\\nwith each other, and in a lesser degree with the surrounding physical\\nconditions.', 'As we have seen in the last chapter that some forms have\\nretained nearly the same character from an enormously remote geological\\nperiod, so certain species have migrated over vast spaces, and have not\\nbecome greatly modified.', 'On these views, it is obvious, that the several species of the same\\ngenus, though inhabiting the most distant quarters of the world, must\\noriginally have proceeded from the same source, as they have descended\\nfrom the same progenitor.', 'In the case of those species, which have\\nundergone during whole geological periods but little modification, there\\nis not much difficulty in believing that they may have migrated from the\\nsame region; for during the vast geographical and climatal changes which\\nwill have supervened since ancient times, almost any amount of migration\\nis possible.', 'But in many other cases, in which we have reason to believe\\nthat the species of a genus have been produced within comparatively\\nrecent times, there is great difficulty on this head.', 'It is also obvious\\nthat the individuals of the same species, though now inhabiting distant\\nand isolated regions, must have proceeded from one spot, where their\\nparents were first produced: for, as explained in the last chapter, it\\nis incredible that individuals identically the same should ever have\\nbeen produced through natural selection from parents specifically\\ndistinct.', \"We are thus brought to the question which has been largely discussed by\\nnaturalists, namely, whether species have been created at one or more\\npoints of the earth's surface.\", 'Undoubtedly there are very many cases of\\nextreme difficulty, in understanding how the same species could possibly\\nhave migrated from some one point to the several distant and isolated\\npoints, where now found.', 'Nevertheless the simplicity of the view that\\neach species was first produced within a single region captivates the\\nmind.', 'He who rejects it, rejects the vera causa of ordinary generation\\nwith subsequent migration, and calls in the agency of a miracle.', 'It is\\nuniversally admitted, that in most cases the area inhabited by a species\\nis continuous; and when a plant or animal inhabits two points so distant\\nfrom each other, or with an interval of such a nature, that the space\\ncould not be easily passed over by migration, the fact is given as\\nsomething remarkable and exceptional.', 'The capacity of migrating across\\nthe sea is more distinctly limited in terrestrial mammals, than perhaps\\nin any other organic beings;

and some of the aboriginal plants\\nare identically the same at these distant points of the northern and\\nsouthern hemispheres?', 'The answer, as I believe, is, that mammals have\\nnot been able to migrate, whereas some plants, from their varied means\\nof dispersal, have migrated across the vast and broken interspace.', 'The\\ngreat and striking influence which barriers of every kind have had on\\ndistribution, is intelligible only on the view that the great majority\\nof species have been produced on one side alone, and have not been able\\nto migrate to the other side.', 'Some few families, many sub-families,\\nvery many genera, and a still greater number of sections of genera\\nare confined to a single region; and it has been observed by several\\nnaturalists, that the most natural genera, or those genera in which the\\nspecies are most closely related to each other, are generally local,\\nor confined to one area.', 'What a strange anomaly it would be, if, when\\ncoming one step lower in the series, to the individuals of the same\\nspecies, a directly opposite rule prevailed; and species were not local,\\nbut had been produced in two or more distinct areas!', 'Hence it seems to me, as it has to many other naturalists, that the\\nview of each species having been produced in one area alone, and having\\nsubsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migration\\nand subsistence under past and present conditions permitted, is the most\\nprobable.', 'Undoubtedly many cases occur, in which we cannot explain how\\nthe same species could have passed from one point to the other.', 'But the\\ngeographical and climatal changes, which have certainly occurred within\\nrecent geological times, must have interrupted or rendered discontinuous\\nthe formerly continuous range of many species.', 'So that we are reduced to\\nconsider whether the exceptions to continuity of range are so numerous\\nand of so grave a nature, that we ought to give up the belief, rendered\\nprobable by general considerations, that each species has been produced\\nwithin one area, and has migrated thence as far as it could.', 'It would\\nbe hopelessly tedious to discuss all the exceptional cases of the same\\nspecies, now living at distant and separated points; nor do I for a\\nmoment pretend that any explanation could be offered of many such cases.', 'But after some preliminary remarks, I will discuss a few of the most\\nstriking classes of facts; namely, the existence of the same species\\non the summits of distant mountain-ranges, and at distant points in the\\narctic and antarctic regions; and secondly (in the following chapter),\\nthe wide distribution of freshwater productions; and thirdly, the\\noccurrence of the same terrestrial species on islands and on the\\nmainland, though separated by hundreds of miles of open sea.', \"If the\\nexistence of the same species at distant and isolated points of the\\nearth's surface, can in many instances be explained on the view of each\\nspecies having migrated from a single birthplace; then, considering our\\nignorance with respect to former climatal and geographical changes and\\nvarious occasional means of transport, the belief that this has been the\\nuniversal law, seems to me incomparably the safest.\", 'In discussing this subject, we shall be enabled at the same time to\\nconsider a point equally important for us, namely, whether the several\\ndistinct species of a genus, which on my theory have all descended from\\na common progenitor, can have migrated (undergoing modification\\nduring some part of their migration) from the area inhabited by their\\nprogenitor.', 'If it can be shown to be almost invariably the case, that\\na region, of which most of its inhabitants are closely related to,\\nor belong to the same genera with the species of a second region, has\\nprobably received at some former period immigrants from this other\\nregion, my theory will be strengthened; for we can clearly understand,\\non the principle of modification, why the inhabitants of a region should\\nbe related to those of another region, whence it has been stocked.', 'A\\nvolcanic island, for instance, upheaved and formed at the distance of a\\nfew hundreds of miles from a continent, would probably receive from it\\nin the course of time a few colonists, and their descendants, though\\nmodified, would still be plainly related by inheritance to the\\ninhabitants of the continent.', 'Cases of this nature are common, and are,\\nas we shall hereafter more fully see, inexplicable on the theory of\\nindependent creation.', 'This view of the relation of species in one region\\nto those in another, does not differ much (by substituting the word\\nvariety for species) from that lately advanced in an ingenious paper by\\nMr. Wallace, in which he concludes, that \"every species has come into\\nexistence coincident both in space and time with a pre-existing\\nclosely allied species.\"', 'And I now know from correspondence, that this\\ncoincidence he attributes to generation with modification.', 'The previous remarks on \"single and multiple centres of creation\" do\\nnot directly bear on another allied question,--namely whether all the\\nindividuals of the same species have descended from a single pair, or\\nsingle hermaphrodite, or whether, as some authors suppose, from many\\nindividuals simultaneously created.', 'With those organic beings which\\nnever intercross (if such exist), the species, on my theory, must have\\ndescended from a succession of improved varieties, which will never have\\nblended with other individuals or varieties, but will have supplanted\\neach other; so that, at each successive stage of modification and\\nimprovement, all the individuals of each variety will have descended\\nfrom a single parent.', 'But in the majority of cases, namely, with\\nall organisms which habitually unite for each birth, or which often\\nintercross, I believe that during the slow process of modification\\nthe individuals of the species will have been kept nearly uniform by\\nintercrossing; so that many individuals will have gone on simultaneously\\nchanging, and the whole amount of modification will not have been due,\\nat each stage, to descent from a single parent.', 'To illustrate what I\\nmean: our English racehorses differ slightly from the horses of every\\nother breed; but they do not owe their difference and superiority to\\ndescent from any single pair, but to continued care in selecting and\\ntraining many individuals during many generations.', 'Before discussing the three classes of facts, which I have selected as\\npresenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the theory of \"single\\ncentres of creation,\" I must say a few words on the means of dispersal.', 'MEANS OF DISPERSAL.', 'Sir C. Lyell and other authors have ably treated this subject.', 'I can\\ngive here only the briefest abstract of the more important facts.', 'Change\\nof climate must have had a powerful influence on migration: a region\\nwhen its climate was different may have been a high road for migration,\\nbut now be impassable; I shall, however, presently have to discuss this\\nbranch of the subject in some detail.', 'Changes of level in the land must\\nalso have been highly influential: a narrow isthmus now separates two\\nmarine faunas; submerge it, or let it formerly have been submerged, and\\nthe two faunas will now blend or may formerly have blended: where the\\nsea now extends, land may at a former period have connected islands or\\npossibly even continents together, and thus have allowed terrestrial\\nproductions to pass from one to the other.', 'No geologist will dispute\\nthat great mutations of level have occurred within the period of\\nexisting organisms.', 'Edward Forbes insisted that all the islands in the\\nAtlantic must recently have been connected with Europe or Africa, and\\nEurope likewise with America.', 'Other authors have thus hypothetically\\nbridged over every ocean, and have united almost every island to some\\nmainland.', 'If indeed the arguments used by Forbes are to be trusted,\\nit must be admitted that scarcely a single island exists which has not\\nrecently been united to some continent.', 'This view cuts the Gordian knot\\nof the dispersal of the same species to the most distant points, and\\nremoves many a difficulty: but to the best of my judgment we are not\\nauthorized in admitting such enormous geographical changes within\\nthe period of existing species.', 'It seems to me that we have abundant\\nevidence of great oscillations of level in our continents; but not of\\nsuch vast changes in their position and extension, as to have united\\nthem within the recent period to each other and to the several\\nintervening oceanic islands.', 'I freely admit the former existence of many\\nislands, now buried beneath the sea, which may have served as halting\\nplaces for plants and for many animals during their migration.', 'In the\\ncoral-producing oceans such sunken islands are now marked, as I believe,\\nby rings of coral or atolls standing over them.', 'Whenever it is fully\\nadmitted, as I believe it will some day be, that each species has\\nproceeded from a single birthplace, and when in the course of time we\\nknow something definite about the means of distribution, we shall be\\nenabled to speculate with security on the former extension of the land.', 'But I do not believe that it will ever be proved that within the recent\\nperiod continents which are now quite separate, have been continuously,\\nor almost continuously, united with each other, and with the many\\nexisting oceanic islands.', 'Several facts in distribution,--such as the\\ngreat difference in the marine faunas on the opposite sides of almost\\nevery continent,--the close relation of the tertiary inhabitants of\\nseveral lands and even seas to their present inhabitants,--a certain\\ndegree of relation (as we shall hereafter see) between the distribution\\nof mammals and the depth of the sea,--these and other such facts seem to\\nme opposed to the admission of such prodigious geographical revolutions\\nwithin the recent period, as are necessitated on the view advanced\\nby Forbes and admitted by his many followers.', 'The nature and relative\\nproportions of the inhabitants of oceanic islands likewise seem to me\\nopposed to the belief of their former continuity with continents.', 'Nor\\ndoes their almost universally volcanic composition favour the admission\\nthat they are the wrecks of sunken continents;--if they had originally\\nexisted as mountain-ranges on the land, some at least of the islands\\nwould have been formed, like other mountain-summits, of granite,\\nmetamorphic schists, old fossiliferous or other such rocks, instead of\\nconsisting of mere piles of volcanic matter.', 'I must now say a few words on what are called accidental means, but\\nwhich more properly might be called occasional means of distribution.', 'I shall here confine myself to plants.', 'In botanical works, this or\\nthat plant is stated to be ill adapted for wide dissemination; but for\\ntransport across the sea, the greater or less facilities may be said to\\nbe almost wholly unknown.', \"Until I tried, with Mr. Berkeley's aid, a\\nfew experiments, it was not even known how far seeds could resist the\\ninjurious action of sea-water.\", 'To my surprise I found that out of 87\\nkinds, 64 germinated after an immersion of 28 days, and a few survived\\nan immersion of 137 days.', 'For convenience sake I chiefly tried small\\nseeds, without the capsule or fruit; and as all of these sank in a few\\ndays, they could not be floated across wide spaces of the sea, whether\\nor not they were injured by the salt-water.', 'Afterwards I tried some\\nlarger fruits, capsules, etc., and some of these floated for a long\\ntime.', 'It is well known what a difference there is in the buoyancy of\\ngreen and seasoned timber; and it occurred to me that floods might wash\\ndown plants or branches, and that these might be dried on the banks, and\\nthen by a fresh rise in the stream be washed into the sea.', 'Hence I was\\nled to dry stems and branches of 94 plants with ripe fruit, and to place\\nthem on sea water.', 'The majority sank quickly, but some which whilst\\ngreen floated for a very short time, when dried floated much longer; for\\ninstance, ripe hazel-nuts sank immediately, but when dried, they floated\\nfor 90 days and afterwards when planted they germinated; an asparagus\\nplant with ripe berries floated for 23 days, when dried it floated\\nfor 85 days, and the seeds afterwards germinated: the ripe seeds of\\nHelosciadium sank in two days, when dried they floated for above 90\\ndays, and afterwards germinated.', 'Altogether out of the 94 dried plants,\\n18 floated for above 28 days, and some of the 18 floated for a very much\\nlonger period.', 'So that as 64/87 seeds germinated after an immersion\\nof 28 days; and as 18/94 plants with ripe fruit (but not all the same\\nspecies as in the foregoing experiment) floated, after being dried, for\\nabove 28 days, as far as we may infer anything from these scanty facts,\\nwe may conclude that the seeds of 14/100 plants of any country might be\\nfloated by sea-currents during 28 days, and would retain their power\\nof germination.', \"In Johnston's Physical Atlas, the average rate of the\\nseveral Atlantic currents is 33 miles per diem (some currents running\\nat the rate of 60 miles per diem); on this average, the seeds of 14/100\\nplants belonging to one country might be floated across 924 miles of sea\\nto another country; and when stranded, if blown to a favourable spot by\\nan inland gale, they would germinate.\", 'Subsequently to my experiments, M. Martens tried similar ones, but in a\\nmuch better manner, for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea,\\nso that they were alternately wet and exposed to the air like really\\nfloating plants.', 'He tried 98 seeds, mostly different from mine; but he\\nchose many large fruits and likewise seeds from plants which live\\nnear the sea; and this would have favoured the average length of\\ntheir flotation and of their resistance to the injurious action of the\\nsalt-water.', 'On the other hand he did not previously dry the plants or\\nbranches with the fruit; and this, as we have seen, would have caused\\nsome of them to have floated much longer.', 'The result was that 18/98 of\\nhis seeds floated for 42 days, and were then capable of germination.', 'But\\nI do not doubt that plants exposed to the waves would float for a less\\ntime than those protected from violent movement as in our experiments.', 'Therefore it would perhaps be safer to assume that the seeds of about\\n10/100 plants of a flora, after having been dried, could be floated\\nacross a space of sea 900 miles in width, and would then germinate.', 'The fact of the larger fruits often floating longer than the small,\\nis interesting; as plants with large seeds or fruit could hardly be\\ntransported by any other means; and Alph.', 'de Candolle has shown that\\nsuch plants generally have restricted ranges.', 'But seeds may be occasionally transported in another manner.', 'Drift\\ntimber is thrown up on most islands, even on those in the midst of the\\nwidest oceans; and the natives of the coral-islands in the Pacific,\\nprocure stones for their tools, solely from the roots of drifted trees,\\nthese stones being a valuable royal tax.', 'I find on examination, that\\nwhen irregularly shaped stones are embedded in the roots of trees, small\\nparcels of earth are very frequently enclosed in their interstices and\\nbehind them,--so perfectly that not a particle could be washed away in\\nthe longest transport: out of one small portion of earth thus COMPLETELY\\nenclosed by wood in an oak about 50 years old, three dicotyledonous\\nplants germinated: I am certain of the accuracy of this observation.', \"Again, I can show that the carcasses of birds, when floating on the sea,\\nsometimes escape being immediately devoured; and seeds of many kinds\\nin the crops of floating birds long retain their vitality: peas and\\nvetches, for instance, are killed by even a few days' immersion in\\nsea-water; but some taken out of the crop of a pigeon, which had\\nfloated on artificial salt-water for 30 days, to my surprise nearly all\\ngerminated.\", 'Living birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in the\\ntransportation of seeds.', 'I could give many facts showing how frequently\\nbirds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances across the\\nocean.', 'We may I think safely assume that under such circumstances their\\nrate of flight would often be 35 miles an hour; and some authors have\\ngiven a far higher estimate.', 'I have never seen an instance of nutritious\\nseeds passing through the intestines of a bird; but hard seeds of fruit\\nwill pass uninjured through even the digestive organs of a turkey.', 'In\\nthe course of two months, I picked up in my garden 12 kinds of seeds,\\nout of the excrement of small birds, and these seemed perfect, and\\nsome of them, which I tried, germinated.', 'But the following fact is more\\nimportant: the crops of birds do not secrete gastric juice, and do not\\nin the least injure, as I know by trial, the germination of seeds;\\nnow after a bird has found and devoured a large supply of food, it is\\npositively asserted that all the grains do not pass into the gizzard for\\n12 or even 18 hours.', 'A bird in this interval might easily be blown to\\nthe distance of 500 miles, and hawks are known to look out for tired\\nbirds, and the contents of their torn crops might thus readily get\\nscattered.', 'Mr. Brent informs me that a friend of his had to give up\\nflying carrier-pigeons from France to England, as the hawks on the\\nEnglish coast destroyed so many on their arrival.', 'Some hawks and owls\\nbolt their prey whole, and after an interval of from twelve to twenty\\nhours, disgorge pellets, which, as I know from experiments made in the\\nZoological Gardens, include seeds capable of germination.', 'Some seeds of\\nthe oat, wheat, millet, canary, hemp, clover, and beet germinated after\\nhaving been from twelve to twenty-one hours in the stomachs of different\\nbirds of prey; and two seeds of beet grew after having been thus\\nretained for two days and fourteen hours.', 'Freshwater fish, I find, eat\\nseeds of many land and water plants: fish are frequently devoured by\\nbirds, and thus the seeds might be transported from place to place.', 'I\\nforced many kinds of seeds into the stomachs of dead fish, and then gave\\ntheir bodies to fishing-eagles, storks, and pelicans; these birds after\\nan interval of many hours, either rejected the seeds in pellets or\\npassed them in their excrement; and several of these seeds retained\\ntheir power of germination.', 'Certain seeds, however, were always killed\\nby this process.', 'Although the beaks and feet of birds are generally quite clean, I can\\nshow that earth sometimes adheres to them: in one instance I removed\\ntwenty-two grains of dry argillaceous earth from one foot of a\\npartridge, and in this earth there was a pebble quite as large as the\\nseed of a vetch.', 'Thus seeds might occasionally be transported to great\\ndistances; for many facts could be given showing that soil almost\\neverywhere is charged with seeds.', 'Reflect for a moment on the millions\\nof quails which annually cross the Mediterranean; and can we doubt that\\nthe earth adhering to their feet would sometimes include a few minute\\nseeds?', 'But I shall presently have to recur to this subject.', 'As icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and stones, and\\nhave even carried brushwood, bones, and the nest of a land-bird, I can\\nhardly doubt that they must occasionally have transported seeds from\\none part to another of the arctic and antarctic regions, as suggested by\\nLyell; and during the Glacial period from one part of the now temperate\\nregions to another.', 'In the Azores, from the large number of the species\\nof plants common to Europe, in comparison with the plants of other\\noceanic islands nearer to the mainland, and (as remarked by Mr. H. C.\\nWatson) from the somewhat northern character of the flora in comparison\\nwith the latitude, I suspected that these islands had been partly\\nstocked by ice-borne seeds, during the Glacial epoch.', 'At my request Sir\\nC. Lyell wrote to M. Hartung to inquire whether he had observed erratic\\nboulders on these islands, and he answered that he had found large\\nfragments of granite and other rocks, which do not occur in the\\narchipelago.', 'Hence we may safely infer that icebergs formerly landed\\ntheir rocky burthens on the shores of these mid-ocean islands, and it\\nis at least possible that they may have brought thither the seeds of\\nnorthern plants.', 'Considering that the several above means of transport, and that several\\nother means, which without doubt remain to be discovered, have been in\\naction year after year, for centuries and tens of thousands of years,\\nit would I think be a marvellous fact if many plants had not thus\\nbecome widely transported.', 'These means of transport are sometimes called\\naccidental, but this is not strictly correct: the currents of the sea\\nare not accidental, nor is the direction of prevalent gales of wind.', 'It should be observed that scarcely any means of transport would carry\\nseeds for very great distances; for seeds do not retain their vitality\\nwhen exposed for a great length of time to the action of seawater; nor\\ncould they be long carried in the crops or intestines of birds.', 'These\\nmeans, however, would suffice for occasional transport across tracts of\\nsea some hundred miles in breadth, or from island to island, or from a\\ncontinent to a neighbouring island, but not from one distant continent\\nto another.', 'The floras of distant continents would not by such means\\nbecome mingled in any great degree; but would remain as distinct as we\\nnow see them to be.', 'The currents, from their course, would never bring\\nseeds from North America to Britain, though they might and do bring\\nseeds from the West Indies to our western shores, where, if not killed\\nby so long an immersion in salt-water, they could not endure our\\nclimate.', 'Almost every year, one or two land-birds are blown across\\nthe whole Atlantic Ocean, from North America to the western shores of\\nIreland and England; but seeds could be transported by these wanderers\\nonly by one means, namely, in dirt sticking to their feet, which is in\\nitself a rare accident.', 'Even in this case, how small would the chance\\nbe of a seed falling on favourable soil, and coming to maturity!', 'But it\\nwould be a great error to argue that because a well-stocked island,\\nlike Great Britain, has not, as far as is known (and it would be very\\ndifficult to prove this), received within the last few centuries,\\nthrough occasional means of transport, immigrants from Europe or any\\nother continent, that a poorly-stocked island, though standing more\\nremote from the mainland, would not receive colonists by similar means.', 'I do not doubt that out of twenty seeds or animals transported to an\\nisland, even if far less well-stocked than Britain, scarcely more than\\none would be so well fitted to its new home, as to become naturalised.', 'But this, as it seems to me, is no valid argument against what would\\nbe effected by occasional means of transport, during the long lapse of\\ngeological time, whilst an island was being upheaved and formed, and\\nbefore it had become fully stocked with inhabitants.', 'On almost bare\\nland, with few or no destructive insects or birds living there, nearly\\nevery seed, which chanced to arrive, would be sure to germinate and\\nsurvive.', 'DISPERSAL DURING THE GLACIAL PERIOD.', 'The identity of many plants and animals, on mountain-summits, separated\\nfrom each other by hundreds of miles of lowlands, where the Alpine\\nspecies could not possibly exist, is one of the most striking cases\\nknown of the same species living at distant points, without the apparent\\npossibility of their having migrated from one to the other.', 'It is indeed\\na remarkable fact to see so many of the same plants living on the snowy\\nregions of the Alps or Pyrenees, and in the extreme northern parts of\\nEurope; but it is far more remarkable, that the plants on the White\\nMountains, in the United States of America, are all the same with those\\nof Labrador, and nearly all the same, as we hear from Asa Gray, with\\nthose on the loftiest mountains of Europe.', 'Even as long ago as 1747,\\nsuch facts led Gmelin to conclude that the same species must have been\\nindependently created at several distinct points; and we might have\\nremained in this same belief, had not Agassiz and others called vivid\\nattention to the Glacial period, which, as we shall immediately see,\\naffords a simple explanation of these facts.', 'We have evidence of almost\\nevery conceivable kind, organic and inorganic, that within a very recent\\ngeological period, central Europe and North America suffered under an\\nArctic climate.', 'The ruins of a house burnt by fire do not tell their\\ntale more plainly, than do the mountains of Scotland and Wales, with\\ntheir scored flanks, polished surfaces, and perched boulders, of the icy\\nstreams with which their valleys were lately filled.', 'So greatly has the\\nclimate of Europe changed, that in Northern Italy, gigantic moraines,\\nleft by old glaciers, are now clothed by the vine and maize.', 'Throughout\\na large part of the United States, erratic boulders, and rocks scored by\\ndrifted icebergs and coast-ice, plainly reveal a former cold period.', 'The former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution of the\\ninhabitants of Europe, as explained with remarkable clearness by Edward\\nForbes, is substantially as follows.', 'But we shall follow the changes\\nmore readily, by supposing a new glacial period to come slowly on, and\\nthen pass away, as formerly occurred.', 'As the cold came on, and as each\\nmore southern zone became fitted for arctic beings and ill-fitted for\\ntheir former more temperate inhabitants, the latter would be supplanted\\nand arctic productions would take their places.', 'The inhabitants of the\\nmore temperate regions would at the same time travel southward, unless\\nthey were stopped by barriers, in which case they would perish.', 'The\\nmountains would become covered with snow and ice, and their former\\nAlpine inhabitants would descend to the plains.', 'By the time that the\\ncold had reached its maximum, we should have a uniform arctic fauna and\\nflora, covering the central parts of Europe, as far south as the Alps\\nand Pyrenees, and even stretching into Spain.', 'The now temperate regions\\nof the United States would likewise be covered by arctic plants and\\nanimals, and these would be nearly the same with those of Europe; for\\nthe present circumpolar inhabitants, which we suppose to have everywhere\\ntravelled southward, are remarkably uniform round the world.', 'We may\\nsuppose that the Glacial period came on a little earlier or later in\\nNorth America than in Europe, so will the southern migration there have\\nbeen a little earlier or later; but this will make no difference in the\\nfinal result.', 'As the warmth returned, the arctic forms would retreat northward,\\nclosely followed up in their retreat by the productions of the more\\ntemperate regions.', 'And as the snow melted from the bases of the\\nmountains, the arctic forms would seize on the cleared and thawed\\nground, always ascending higher and higher, as the warmth increased,\\nwhilst their brethren were pursuing their northern journey.', 'Hence, when\\nthe warmth had fully returned, the same arctic species, which had lately\\nlived in a body together on the lowlands of the Old and New Worlds,\\nwould be left isolated on distant mountain-summits (having been\\nexterminated on all lesser heights) and in the arctic regions of both\\nhemispheres.', 'Thus we can understand the identity of many plants at points so\\nimmensely remote as on the mountains of the United States and of Europe.', 'We can thus also understand the fact that the Alpine plants of each\\nmountain-range are more especially related to the arctic forms living\\ndue north or nearly due north of them: for the migration as the cold\\ncame on, and the re-migration on the returning warmth, will generally\\nhave been due south and north.', 'The Alpine plants, for example, of\\nScotland, as remarked by Mr. H. C. Watson, and those of the Pyrenees, as\\nremarked by Ramond, are more especially allied to the plants of northern\\nScandinavia; those of the United States to Labrador; those of the\\nmountains of Siberia to the arctic regions of that country.', 'These views,\\ngrounded as they are on the perfectly well-ascertained occurrence of a\\nformer Glacial period, seem to me to explain in so satisfactory a manner\\nthe present distribution of the Alpine and Arctic productions of Europe\\nand America, that when in other regions we find the same species on\\ndistant mountain-summits, we may almost conclude without other evidence,\\nthat a colder climate permitted their former migration across the low\\nintervening tracts, since become too warm for their existence.', 'If the climate, since the Glacial period, has ever been in any degree\\nwarmer than at present (as some geologists in the United States believe\\nto have been the case, chiefly from the distribution of the fossil\\nGnathodon), then the arctic and temperate productions will at a very\\nlate period have marched a little further north, and subsequently have\\nretreated to their present homes; but I have met with no satisfactory\\nevidence with respect to this intercalated slightly warmer period, since\\nthe Glacial period.', 'The arctic forms, during their long southern migration and re-migration\\nnorthward, will have been exposed to nearly the same climate, and, as\\nis especially to be noticed, they will have kept in a body together;\\nconsequently their mutual relations will not have been much disturbed,\\nand, in accordance with the principles inculcated in this volume, they\\nwill not have been liable to much modification.', 'But with our Alpine\\nproductions, left isolated from the moment of the returning warmth,\\nfirst at the bases and ultimately on the summits of the mountains, the\\ncase will have been somewhat different; for it is not likely that all\\nthe same arctic species will have been left on mountain ranges distant\\nfrom each other, and have survived there ever since; they will, also, in\\nall probability have become mingled with ancient Alpine species, which\\nmust have existed on the mountains before the commencement of the\\nGlacial epoch, and which during its coldest period will have been\\ntemporarily driven down to the plains; they will, also, have been\\nexposed to somewhat different climatal influences.', 'Their mutual\\nrelations will thus have been in some degree disturbed; consequently\\nthey will have been liable to modification; and this we find has been\\nthe case; for if we compare the present Alpine plants and animals of the\\nseveral great European mountain-ranges, though very many of the species\\nare identically the same, some present varieties, some are ranked\\nas doubtful forms, and some few are distinct yet closely allied or\\nrepresentative species.', 'In illustrating what, as I believe, actually took place during\\nthe Glacial period, I assumed that at its commencement the arctic\\nproductions were as uniform round the polar regions as they are at the\\npresent day.', 'But the foregoing remarks on distribution apply not only\\nto strictly arctic forms, but also to many sub-arctic and to some few\\nnorthern temperate forms, for some of these are the same on the lower\\nmountains and on the plains of North America and Europe; and it may be\\nreasonably asked how I account for the necessary degree of uniformity\\nof the sub-arctic and northern temperate forms round the world, at the\\ncommencement of the Glacial period.', 'At the present day, the sub-arctic\\nand northern temperate productions of the Old and New Worlds are\\nseparated from each other by the Atlantic Ocean and by the extreme\\nnorthern part of the Pacific.', 'During the Glacial period, when the\\ninhabitants of the Old and New Worlds lived further southwards than at\\npresent, they must have been still more completely separated by wider\\nspaces of ocean.', 'I believe the above difficulty may be surmounted by\\nlooking to still earlier changes of climate of an opposite nature.', 'We have good reason to believe that during the newer Pliocene period,\\nbefore the Glacial epoch, and whilst the majority of the inhabitants of\\nthe world were specifically the same as now, the climate was warmer than\\nat the present day.', 'Hence we may suppose that the organisms now living\\nunder the climate of latitude 60 deg, during the Pliocene period lived\\nfurther north under the Polar Circle, in latitude 66 deg-67 deg; and\\nthat the strictly arctic productions then lived on the broken land still\\nnearer to the pole.', 'Now if we look at a globe, we shall see that under\\nthe Polar Circle there is almost continuous land from western Europe,\\nthrough Siberia, to eastern America.', 'And to this continuity of the\\ncircumpolar land, and to the consequent freedom for intermigration\\nunder a more favourable climate, I attribute the necessary amount of\\nuniformity in the sub-arctic and northern temperate productions of the\\nOld and New Worlds, at a period anterior to the Glacial epoch.', 'Believing, from reasons before alluded to, that our continents have\\nlong remained in nearly the same relative position, though subjected\\nto large, but partial oscillations of level, I am strongly inclined to\\nextend the above view, and to infer that during some earlier and still\\nwarmer period, such as the older Pliocene period, a large number of\\nthe same plants and animals inhabited the almost continuous circumpolar\\nland; and that these plants and animals, both in the Old and New Worlds,\\nbegan slowly to migrate southwards as the climate became less warm, long\\nbefore the commencement of the Glacial period.', 'We now see, as I believe,\\ntheir descendants, mostly in a modified condition, in the central parts\\nof Europe and the United States.', 'On this view we can understand the\\nrelationship, with very little identity, between the productions of\\nNorth America and Europe,--a relationship which is most remarkable,\\nconsidering the distance of the two areas, and their separation by the\\nAtlantic Ocean.', 'We can further understand the singular fact remarked on\\nby several observers, that the productions of Europe and America during\\nthe later tertiary stages were more closely related to each other\\nthan they are at the present time; for during these warmer periods\\nthe northern parts of the Old and New Worlds will have been almost\\ncontinuously united by land, serving as a bridge, since rendered\\nimpassable by cold, for the inter-migration of their inhabitants.', 'During the slowly decreasing warmth of the Pliocene period, as soon as\\nthe species in common, which inhabited the New and Old Worlds, migrated\\nsouth of the Polar Circle, they must have been completely cut off from\\neach other.', 'This separation, as far as the more temperate productions\\nare concerned, took place long ages ago.', 'And as the plants and animals\\nmigrated southward, they will have become mingled in the one great\\nregion with the native American productions, and have had to compete\\nwith them; and in the other great region, with those of the Old\\nWorld.', 'Consequently we have here everything favourable for much\\nmodification,--for far more modification than with the Alpine\\nproductions, left isolated, within a much more recent period, on the\\nseveral mountain-ranges and on the arctic lands of the two Worlds.', 'Hence\\nit has come, that when we compare the now living productions of the\\ntemperate regions of the New and Old Worlds, we find very few identical\\nspecies (though Asa Gray has lately shown that more plants are identical\\nthan was formerly supposed), but we find in every great class many\\nforms, which some naturalists rank as geographical races, and others as\\ndistinct species; and a host of closely allied or representative forms\\nwhich are ranked by all naturalists as specifically distinct.', 'As on the land, so in the waters of the sea, a slow southern migration\\nof a marine fauna, which during the Pliocene or even a somewhat earlier\\nperiod, was nearly uniform along the continuous shores of the Polar\\nCircle, will account, on the theory of modification, for many closely\\nallied forms now living in areas completely sundered.', \"Thus, I think, we\\ncan understand the presence of many existing and tertiary representative\\nforms on the eastern and western shores of temperate North America;\\nand the still more striking case of many closely allied crustaceans\\n(as described in Dana's admirable work), of some fish and other marine\\nanimals, in the Mediterranean and in the seas of Japan,--areas now\\nseparated by a continent and by nearly a hemisphere of equatorial ocean.\", 'These cases of relationship, without identity, of the inhabitants of\\nseas now disjoined, and likewise of the past and present inhabitants of\\nthe temperate lands of North America and Europe, are inexplicable on the\\ntheory of creation.', 'We cannot say that they have been created alike, in\\ncorrespondence with the nearly similar physical conditions of the areas;\\nfor if we compare, for instance, certain parts of South America with\\nthe southern continents of the Old World, we see countries closely\\ncorresponding in all their physical conditions, but with their\\ninhabitants utterly dissimilar.', 'But we must return to our more immediate subject, the Glacial period.', \"I am convinced that Forbes's view may be largely extended.\", 'In Europe we\\nhave the plainest evidence of the cold period, from the western shores\\nof Britain to the Oural range, and southward to the Pyrenees.', 'We may\\ninfer, from the frozen mammals and nature of the mountain vegetation,\\nthat Siberia was similarly affected.', 'Along the Himalaya, at points 900\\nmiles apart, glaciers have left the marks of their former low descent;\\nand in Sikkim, Dr. Hooker saw maize growing on gigantic ancient\\nmoraines.', 'South of the equator, we have some direct evidence of former\\nglacial action in New Zealand;

Richardson, also, speaks of the reappearance on the\\nshores of New Zealand, Tasmania, etc., of northern forms of fish.', 'Dr.\\nHooker informs me that twenty-five species of Algae are common to New\\nZealand and to Europe, but have not been found in the intermediate\\ntropical seas.', 'It should be observed that the northern species and forms found in the\\nsouthern parts of the southern hemisphere, and on the mountain-ranges\\nof the intertropical regions, are not arctic, but belong to the northern\\ntemperate zones.', 'As Mr. H. C. Watson has recently remarked, \"In receding\\nfrom polar towards equatorial latitudes, the Alpine or mountain floras\\nreally become less and less arctic.\"', 'Many of the forms living on\\nthe mountains of the warmer regions of the earth and in the southern\\nhemisphere are of doubtful value, being ranked by some naturalists as\\nspecifically distinct, by others as varieties; but some are certainly\\nidentical, and many, though closely related to northern forms, must be\\nranked as distinct species.', 'Now let us see what light can be thrown on the foregoing facts, on the\\nbelief, supported as it is by a large body of geological evidence, that\\nthe whole world, or a large part of it, was during the Glacial period\\nsimultaneously much colder than at present.', 'The Glacial period, as\\nmeasured by years, must have been very long; and when we remember over\\nwhat vast spaces some naturalised plants and animals have spread within\\na few centuries, this period will have been ample for any amount of\\nmigration.', 'As the cold came slowly on, all the tropical plants and other\\nproductions will have retreated from both sides towards the equator,\\nfollowed in the rear by the temperate productions, and these by the\\narctic; but with the latter we are not now concerned.', 'The tropical\\nplants probably suffered much extinction; how much no one can say;\\nperhaps formerly the tropics supported as many species as we see at the\\npresent day crowded together at the Cape of Good Hope, and in parts of\\ntemperate Australia.', 'As we know that many tropical plants and animals\\ncan withstand a considerable amount of cold, many might have escaped\\nextermination during a moderate fall of temperature, more especially by\\nescaping into the warmest spots.', 'But the great fact to bear in mind is,\\nthat all tropical productions will have suffered to a certain extent.', 'On\\nthe other hand, the temperate productions, after migrating nearer to\\nthe equator, though they will have been placed under somewhat new\\nconditions, will have suffered less.', 'And it is certain that many\\ntemperate plants, if protected from the inroads of competitors, can\\nwithstand a much warmer climate than their own.', 'Hence, it seems to\\nme possible, bearing in mind that the tropical productions were in\\na suffering state and could not have presented a firm front against\\nintruders, that a certain number of the more vigorous and dominant\\ntemperate forms might have penetrated the native ranks and have reached\\nor even crossed the equator.', 'The invasion would, of course, have been\\ngreatly favoured by high land, and perhaps by a dry climate; for Dr.\\nFalconer informs me that it is the damp with the heat of the tropics\\nwhich is so destructive to perennial plants from a temperate climate.', 'On\\nthe other hand, the most humid and hottest districts will have afforded\\nan asylum to the tropical natives.', 'The mountain-ranges north-west of the\\nHimalaya, and the long line of the Cordillera, seem to have afforded two\\ngreat lines of invasion: and it is a striking fact, lately communicated\\nto me by Dr. Hooker, that all the flowering plants, about forty-six in\\nnumber, common to Tierra del Fuego and to Europe still exist in North\\nAmerica, which must have lain on the line of march.', 'But I do not doubt\\nthat some temperate productions entered and crossed even the LOWLANDS of\\nthe tropics at the period when the cold was most intense,--when arctic\\nforms had migrated some twenty-five degrees of latitude from their\\nnative country and covered the land at the foot of the Pyrenees.', 'At this\\nperiod of extreme cold, I believe that the climate under the equator at\\nthe level of the sea was about the same with that now felt there at the\\nheight of six or seven thousand feet.', 'During this the coldest period, I\\nsuppose that large spaces of the tropical lowlands were clothed with a\\nmingled tropical and temperate vegetation, like that now growing with\\nstrange luxuriance at the base of the Himalaya, as graphically described\\nby Hooker.', 'Thus, as I believe, a considerable number of plants, a few terrestrial\\nanimals, and some marine productions, migrated during the Glacial period\\nfrom the northern and southern temperate zones into the intertropical\\nregions, and some even crossed the equator.', 'As the warmth returned,\\nthese temperate forms would naturally ascend the higher mountains, being\\nexterminated on the lowlands; those which had not reached the equator,\\nwould re-migrate northward or southward towards their former homes; but\\nthe forms, chiefly northern, which had crossed the equator, would travel\\nstill further from their homes into the more temperate latitudes of the\\nopposite hemisphere.', 'Although we have reason to believe from geological\\nevidence that the whole body of arctic shells underwent scarcely any\\nmodification during their long southern migration and re-migration\\nnorthward, the case may have been wholly different with those intruding\\nforms which settled themselves on the intertropical mountains, and in\\nthe southern hemisphere.', 'These being surrounded by strangers will have\\nhad to compete with many new forms of life; and it is probable that\\nselected modifications in their structure, habits, and constitutions\\nwill have profited them.', 'Thus many of these wanderers, though still\\nplainly related by inheritance to their brethren of the northern or\\nsouthern hemispheres, now exist in their new homes as well-marked\\nvarieties or as distinct species.', 'It is a remarkable fact, strongly insisted on by Hooker in regard to\\nAmerica, and by Alph.', 'de Candolle in regard to Australia, that many\\nmore identical plants and allied forms have apparently migrated from the\\nnorth to the south, than in a reversed direction.', 'We see, however, a\\nfew southern vegetable forms on the mountains of Borneo and Abyssinia.', 'I suspect that this preponderant migration from north to south is due\\nto the greater extent of land in the north, and to the northern forms\\nhaving existed in their own homes in greater numbers, and having\\nconsequently been advanced through natural selection and competition\\nto a higher stage of perfection or dominating power, than the southern\\nforms.', 'And thus, when they became commingled during the Glacial period,\\nthe northern forms were enabled to beat the less powerful southern\\nforms.', 'Just in the same manner as we see at the present day, that very\\nmany European productions cover the ground in La Plata, and in a lesser\\ndegree in Australia, and have to a certain extent beaten the natives;\\nwhereas extremely few southern forms have become naturalised in any part\\nof Europe, though hides, wool, and other objects likely to carry seeds\\nhave been largely imported into Europe during the last two or three\\ncenturies from La Plata, and during the last thirty or forty years\\nfrom Australia.', 'Something of the same kind must have occurred on the\\nintertropical mountains: no doubt before the Glacial period they were\\nstocked with endemic Alpine forms; but these have almost everywhere\\nlargely yielded to the more dominant forms, generated in the larger\\nareas and more efficient workshops of the north.', 'In many islands the\\nnative productions are nearly equalled or even outnumbered by the\\nnaturalised; and if the natives have not been actually exterminated,\\ntheir numbers have been greatly reduced, and this is the first stage\\ntowards extinction.', \"A mountain is an island on the land; and the\\nintertropical mountains before the Glacial period must have been\\ncompletely isolated; and I believe that the productions of these islands\\non the land yielded to those produced within the larger areas of the\\nnorth, just in the same way as the productions of real islands have\\neverywhere lately yielded to continental forms, naturalised by man's\\nagency.\", 'I am far from supposing that all difficulties are removed on the view\\nhere given in regard to the range and affinities of the allied species\\nwhich live in the northern and southern temperate zones and on the\\nmountains of the intertropical regions.', 'Very many difficulties remain\\nto be solved.', 'I do not pretend to indicate the exact lines and means\\nof migration, or the reason why certain species and not others have\\nmigrated; why certain species have been modified and have given rise to\\nnew groups of forms, and others have remained unaltered.', \"We cannot hope\\nto explain such facts, until we can say why one species and not another\\nbecomes naturalised by man's agency in a foreign land; why one ranges\\ntwice or thrice as far, and is twice or thrice as common, as another\\nspecies within their own homes.\", 'I have said that many difficulties remain to be solved: some of the\\nmost remarkable are stated with admirable clearness by Dr. Hooker in\\nhis botanical works on the antarctic regions.', 'These cannot be here\\ndiscussed.', 'I will only say that as far as regards the occurrence of\\nidentical species at points so enormously remote as Kerguelen Land, New\\nZealand, and Fuegia, I believe that towards the close of the Glacial\\nperiod, icebergs, as suggested by Lyell, have been largely concerned in\\ntheir dispersal.', 'But the existence of several quite distinct species,\\nbelonging to genera exclusively confined to the south, at these and\\nother distant points of the southern hemisphere, is, on my theory of\\ndescent with modification, a far more remarkable case of difficulty.', 'For\\nsome of these species are so distinct, that we cannot suppose that there\\nhas been time since the commencement of the Glacial period for their\\nmigration, and for their subsequent modification to the necessary\\ndegree.', 'The facts seem to me to indicate that peculiar and very distinct\\nspecies have migrated in radiating lines from some common centre; and I\\nam inclined to look in the southern, as in the northern hemisphere, to a\\nformer and warmer period, before the commencement of the Glacial period,\\nwhen the antarctic lands, now covered with ice, supported a highly\\npeculiar and isolated flora.', 'I suspect that before this flora was\\nexterminated by the Glacial epoch, a few forms were widely dispersed\\nto various points of the southern hemisphere by occasional means of\\ntransport, and by the aid, as halting-places, of existing and now sunken\\nislands, and perhaps at the commencement of the Glacial period, by\\nicebergs.', 'By these means, as I believe, the southern shores of America,\\nAustralia, New Zealand have become slightly tinted by the same peculiar\\nforms of vegetable life.', 'Sir C. Lyell in a striking passage has speculated, in language almost\\nidentical with mine, on the effects of great alternations of climate on\\ngeographical distribution.', 'I believe that the world has recently felt\\none of his great cycles of change; and that on this view, combined with\\nmodification through natural selection, a multitude of facts in the\\npresent distribution both of the same and of allied forms of life can be\\nexplained.', 'The living waters may be said to have flowed during one short\\nperiod from the north and from the south, and to have crossed at the\\nequator; but to have flowed with greater force from the north so as\\nto have freely inundated the south.', 'As the tide leaves its drift in\\nhorizontal lines, though rising higher on the shores where the tide\\nrises highest, so have the living waters left their living drift on our\\nmountain-summits, in a line gently rising from the arctic lowlands to\\na great height under the equator.', 'The various beings thus left stranded\\nmay be compared with savage races of man, driven up and surviving in the\\nmountain-fastnesses of almost every land, which serve as a record,\\nfull of interest to us, of the former inhabitants of the surrounding\\nlowlands.', '12.', 'GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION--continued.', 'Distribution of fresh-water productions.', 'On the inhabitants of oceanic\\nislands.', 'Absence of Batrachians and of terrestrial Mammals.', 'On the\\nrelation of the inhabitants of islands to those of the nearest mainland.', 'On colonisation from the nearest source with subsequent modification.', 'Summary of the last and present chapters.', 'As lakes and river-systems are separated from each other by barriers of\\nland, it might have been thought that fresh-water productions would not\\nhave ranged widely within the same country, and as the sea is apparently\\na still more impassable barrier, that they never would have extended to\\ndistant countries.', 'But the case is exactly the reverse.', 'Not only have\\nmany fresh-water species, belonging to quite different classes, an\\nenormous range, but allied species prevail in a remarkable manner\\nthroughout the world.', 'I well remember, when first collecting in the\\nfresh waters of Brazil, feeling much surprise at the similarity of\\nthe fresh-water insects, shells, etc., and at the dissimilarity of the\\nsurrounding terrestrial beings, compared with those of Britain.', 'But this power in fresh-water productions of ranging widely, though so\\nunexpected, can, I think, in most cases be explained by their having\\nbecome fitted, in a manner highly useful to them, for short and frequent\\nmigrations from pond to pond, or from stream to stream; and liability\\nto wide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost necessary\\nconsequence.', 'We can here consider only a few cases.', 'In regard to fish, I\\nbelieve that the same species never occur in the fresh waters of distant\\ncontinents.', 'But on the same continent the species often range widely and\\nalmost capriciously; for two river-systems will have some fish in common\\nand some different.', 'A few facts seem to favour the possibility of their\\noccasional transport by accidental means; like that of the live fish\\nnot rarely dropped by whirlwinds in India, and the vitality of their\\nova when removed from the water.', 'But I am inclined to attribute the\\ndispersal of fresh-water fish mainly to slight changes within the recent\\nperiod in the level of the land, having caused rivers to flow into each\\nother.', 'Instances, also, could be given of this having occurred during\\nfloods, without any change of level.', 'We have evidence in the loess of\\nthe Rhine of considerable changes of level in the land within a very\\nrecent geological period, and when the surface was peopled by existing\\nland and fresh-water shells.', 'The wide difference of the fish on opposite\\nsides of continuous mountain-ranges, which from an early period must\\nhave parted river-systems and completely prevented their inosculation,\\nseems to lead to this same conclusion.', 'With respect to allied\\nfresh-water fish occurring at very distant points of the world, no doubt\\nthere are many cases which cannot at present be explained: but some\\nfresh-water fish belong to very ancient forms, and in such cases\\nthere will have been ample time for great geographical changes, and\\nconsequently time and means for much migration.', 'In the second place,\\nsalt-water fish can with care be slowly accustomed to live in fresh\\nwater; and, according to Valenciennes, there is hardly a single group of\\nfishes confined exclusively to fresh water, so that we may imagine that\\na marine member of a fresh-water group might travel far along the shores\\nof the sea, and subsequently become modified and adapted to the fresh\\nwaters of a distant land.', 'Some species of fresh-water shells have a very wide range, and allied\\nspecies, which, on my theory, are descended from a common parent and\\nmust have proceeded from a single source, prevail throughout the world.', 'Their distribution at first perplexed me much, as their ova are not\\nlikely to be transported by birds, and they are immediately killed\\nby sea water, as are the adults.', 'I could not even understand how some\\nnaturalised species have rapidly spread throughout the same country.', 'But\\ntwo facts, which I have observed--and no doubt many others remain to be\\nobserved--throw some light on this subject.', 'When a duck suddenly emerges\\nfrom a pond covered with duck-weed, I have twice seen these little\\nplants adhering to its back; and it has happened to me, in removing\\na little duck-weed from one aquarium to another, that I have quite\\nunintentionally stocked the one with fresh-water shells from the other.', \"But another agency is perhaps more effectual: I suspended a duck's feet,\\nwhich might represent those of a bird sleeping in a natural pond, in\\nan aquarium, where many ova of fresh-water shells were hatching; and\\nI found that numbers of the extremely minute and just hatched shells\\ncrawled on the feet, and clung to them so firmly that when taken out\\nof the water they could not be jarred off, though at a somewhat more\\nadvanced age they would voluntarily drop off.\", \"These just hatched\\nmolluscs, though aquatic in their nature, survived on the duck's feet,\\nin damp air, from twelve to twenty hours; and in this length of time a\\nduck or heron might fly at least six or seven hundred miles, and would\\nbe sure to alight on a pool or rivulet, if blown across sea to an\\noceanic island or to any other distant point.\", \"Sir Charles Lyell also\\ninforms me that a Dyticus has been caught with an Ancylus (a fresh-water\\nshell like a limpet) firmly adhering to it; and a water-beetle of\\nthe same family, a Colymbetes, once flew on board the 'Beagle,' when\\nforty-five miles distant from the nearest land: how much farther it\\nmight have flown with a favouring gale no one can tell.\", 'With respect to plants, it has long been known what enormous ranges many\\nfresh-water and even marsh-species have, both over continents and to the\\nmost remote oceanic islands.', 'This is strikingly shown, as remarked by\\nAlph.', 'de Candolle, in large groups of terrestrial plants, which have\\nonly a very few aquatic members; for these latter seem immediately to\\nacquire, as if in consequence, a very wide range.', 'I think favourable\\nmeans of dispersal explain this fact.', 'I have before mentioned that earth\\noccasionally, though rarely, adheres in some quantity to the feet and\\nbeaks of birds.', 'Wading birds, which frequent the muddy edges of ponds,\\nif suddenly flushed, would be the most likely to have muddy feet.', 'Birds of this order I can show are the greatest wanderers, and are\\noccasionally found on the most remote and barren islands in the open\\nocean; they would not be likely to alight on the surface of the sea, so\\nthat the dirt would not be washed off their feet; when making land,\\nthey would be sure to fly to their natural fresh-water haunts.', 'I do not\\nbelieve that botanists are aware how charged the mud of ponds is with\\nseeds: I have tried several little experiments, but will here give only\\nthe most striking case: I took in February three table-spoonfuls of\\nmud from three different points, beneath water, on the edge of a little\\npond; this mud when dry weighed only 6 3/4 ounces; I kept it covered\\nup in my study for six months, pulling up and counting each plant as it\\ngrew; the plants were of many kinds, and were altogether 537 in number;\\nand yet the viscid mud was all contained in a breakfast cup!', 'Considering\\nthese facts, I think it would be an inexplicable circumstance if\\nwater-birds did not transport the seeds of fresh-water plants to vast\\ndistances, and if consequently the range of these plants was not very\\ngreat.', 'The same agency may have come into play with the eggs of some of\\nthe smaller fresh-water animals.', 'Other and unknown agencies probably have also played a part.', 'I have\\nstated that fresh-water fish eat some kinds of seeds, though they reject\\nmany other kinds after having swallowed them; even small fish swallow\\nseeds of moderate size, as of the yellow water-lily and Potamogeton.', 'Herons and other birds, century after century, have gone on daily\\ndevouring fish; they then take flight and go to other waters, or are\\nblown across the sea; and we have seen that seeds retain their power\\nof germination, when rejected in pellets or in excrement, many hours\\nafterwards.', 'When I saw the great size of the seeds of that fine\\nwater-lily, the Nelumbium, and remembered Alph.', \"de Candolle's remarks\\non this plant, I thought that its distribution must remain quite\\ninexplicable; but Audubon states that he found the seeds of the great\\nsouthern water-lily (probably, according to Dr. Hooker, the Nelumbium\\nluteum) in a heron's stomach; although I do not know the fact, yet\\nanalogy makes me believe that a heron flying to another pond and getting\\na hearty meal of fish, would probably reject from its stomach a pellet\\ncontaining the seeds of the Nelumbium undigested; or the seeds might be\\ndropped by the bird whilst feeding its young, in the same way as fish\\nare known sometimes to be dropped.\", 'In considering these several means of distribution, it should be\\nremembered that when a pond or stream is first formed, for instance,\\non a rising islet, it will be unoccupied; and a single seed or egg\\nwill have a good chance of succeeding.', 'Although there will always be a\\nstruggle for life between the individuals of the species, however\\nfew, already occupying any pond, yet as the number of kinds is small,\\ncompared with those on the land, the competition will probably be less\\nsevere between aquatic than between terrestrial species; consequently\\nan intruder from the waters of a foreign country, would have a better\\nchance of seizing on a place, than in the case of terrestrial colonists.', 'We should, also, remember that some, perhaps many, fresh-water\\nproductions are low in the scale of nature, and that we have reason to\\nbelieve that such low beings change or become modified less quickly\\nthan the high; and this will give longer time than the average for\\nthe migration of the same aquatic species.', 'We should not forget the\\nprobability of many species having formerly ranged as continuously as\\nfresh-water productions ever can range, over immense areas, and having\\nsubsequently become extinct in intermediate regions.', 'But the wide\\ndistribution of fresh-water plants and of the lower animals, whether\\nretaining the same identical form or in some degree modified, I believe\\nmainly depends on the wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals,\\nmore especially by fresh-water birds, which have large powers of flight,\\nand naturally travel from one to another and often distant piece of\\nwater.', 'Nature, like a careful gardener, thus takes her seeds from a bed\\nof a particular nature, and drops them in another equally well fitted\\nfor them.', 'ON THE INHABITANTS OF OCEANIC ISLANDS.', 'We now come to the last of the three classes of facts, which I have\\nselected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty, on the view\\nthat all the individuals both of the same and of allied species have\\ndescended from a single parent; and therefore have all proceeded from a\\ncommon birthplace, notwithstanding that in the course of time they have\\ncome to inhabit distant points of the globe.', \"I have already stated that\\nI cannot honestly admit Forbes's view on continental extensions, which,\\nif legitimately followed out, would lead to the belief that within the\\nrecent period all existing islands have been nearly or quite joined to\\nsome continent.\", 'This view would remove many difficulties, but it would\\nnot, I think, explain all the facts in regard to insular productions.', 'In\\nthe following remarks I shall not confine myself to the mere question of\\ndispersal; but shall consider some other facts, which bear on the\\ntruth of the two theories of independent creation and of descent with\\nmodification.', 'The species of all kinds which inhabit oceanic islands are few in number\\ncompared with those on equal continental areas: Alph.', 'de Candolle admits\\nthis for plants, and Wollaston for insects.', 'If we look to the large\\nsize and varied stations of New Zealand, extending over 780 miles of\\nlatitude, and compare its flowering plants, only 750 in number, with\\nthose on an equal area at the Cape of Good Hope or in Australia,\\nwe must, I think, admit that something quite independently of any\\ndifference in physical conditions has caused so great a difference in\\nnumber.', 'Even the uniform county of Cambridge has 847 plants, and the\\nlittle island of Anglesea 764, but a few ferns and a few introduced\\nplants are included in these numbers, and the comparison in some other\\nrespects is not quite fair.', 'We have evidence that the barren island of\\nAscension aboriginally possessed under half-a-dozen flowering plants;\\nyet many have become naturalised on it, as they have on New Zealand and\\non every other oceanic island which can be named.', 'In St. Helena there is\\nreason to believe that the naturalised plants and animals have nearly or\\nquite exterminated many native productions.', 'He who admits the doctrine\\nof the creation of each separate species, will have to admit, that a\\nsufficient number of the best adapted plants and animals have not been\\ncreated on oceanic islands; for man has unintentionally stocked them\\nfrom various sources far more fully and perfectly than has nature.', 'Although in oceanic islands the number of kinds of inhabitants is\\nscanty, the proportion of endemic species (i.e.', 'those found nowhere else\\nin the world) is often extremely large.', 'If we compare, for instance, the\\nnumber of the endemic land-shells in Madeira, or of the endemic birds in\\nthe Galapagos Archipelago, with the number found on any continent, and\\nthen compare the area of the islands with that of the continent, we\\nshall see that this is true.', 'This fact might have been expected on my\\ntheory, for, as already explained, species occasionally arriving after\\nlong intervals in a new and isolated district, and having to compete\\nwith new associates, will be eminently liable to modification, and\\nwill often produce groups of modified descendants.', 'But it by no means\\nfollows, that, because in an island nearly all the species of one class\\nare peculiar, those of another class, or of another section of the same\\nclass, are peculiar; and this difference seems to depend on the species\\nwhich do not become modified having immigrated with facility and in a\\nbody, so that their mutual relations have not been much disturbed.', 'Thus\\nin the Galapagos Islands nearly every land-bird, but only two out of the\\neleven marine birds, are peculiar; and it is obvious that marine birds\\ncould arrive at these islands more easily than land-birds.', \"Bermuda, on\\nthe other hand, which lies at about the same distance from North America\\nas the Galapagos Islands do from South America, and which has a very\\npeculiar soil, does not possess one endemic land bird; and we know from\\nMr. J. M. Jones's admirable account of Bermuda, that very many North\\nAmerican birds, during their great annual migrations, visit either\\nperiodically or occasionally this island.\", 'Madeira does not possess one\\npeculiar bird, and many European and African birds are almost every year\\nblown there, as I am informed by Mr. E. V. Harcourt.', 'So that these two\\nislands of Bermuda and Madeira have been stocked by birds, which for\\nlong ages have struggled together in their former homes, and have become\\nmutually adapted to each other; and when settled in their new homes,\\neach kind will have been kept by the others to their proper places and\\nhabits, and will consequently have been little liable to modification.', 'Madeira, again, is inhabited by a wonderful number of peculiar\\nland-shells, whereas not one species of sea-shell is confined to its\\nshores: now, though we do not know how seashells are dispersed, yet\\nwe can see that their eggs or larvae, perhaps attached to seaweed or\\nfloating timber, or to the feet of wading-birds, might be transported\\nfar more easily than land-shells, across three or four hundred miles of\\nopen sea.', 'The different orders of insects in Madeira apparently present\\nanalogous facts.', 'Oceanic islands are sometimes deficient in certain classes, and\\ntheir places are apparently occupied by the other inhabitants; in the\\nGalapagos Islands reptiles, and in New Zealand gigantic wingless birds,\\ntake the place of mammals.', 'In the plants of the Galapagos Islands, Dr.\\nHooker has shown that the proportional numbers of the different\\norders are very different from what they are elsewhere.', 'Such cases are\\ngenerally accounted for by the physical conditions of the islands;\\nbut this explanation seems to me not a little doubtful.', 'Facility of\\nimmigration, I believe, has been at least as important as the nature of\\nthe conditions.', 'Many remarkable little facts could be given with respect to the\\ninhabitants of remote islands.', 'For instance, in certain islands not\\ntenanted by mammals, some of the endemic plants have beautifully hooked\\nseeds; yet few relations are more striking than the adaptation of hooked\\nseeds for transportal by the wool and fur of quadrupeds.', 'This\\ncase presents no difficulty on my view, for a hooked seed might be\\ntransported to an island by some other means; and the plant then\\nbecoming slightly modified, but still retaining its hooked seeds,\\nwould form an endemic species, having as useless an appendage as any\\nrudimentary organ,--for instance, as the shrivelled wings under the\\nsoldered elytra of many insular beetles.', 'Again, islands often possess\\ntrees or bushes belonging to orders which elsewhere include only\\nherbaceous species; now trees, as Alph.', 'de Candolle has shown, generally\\nhave, whatever the cause may be, confined ranges.', 'Hence trees would be\\nlittle likely to reach distant oceanic islands; and an herbaceous plant,\\nthough it would have no chance of successfully competing in stature\\nwith a fully developed tree, when established on an island and having to\\ncompete with herbaceous plants alone, might readily gain an advantage\\nby growing taller and taller and overtopping the other plants.', 'If so,\\nnatural selection would often tend to add to the stature of herbaceous\\nplants when growing on an island, to whatever order they belonged, and\\nthus convert them first into bushes and ultimately into trees.', 'With respect to the absence of whole orders on oceanic islands, Bory St.\\nVincent long ago remarked that Batrachians (frogs, toads, newts) have\\nnever been found on any of the many islands with which the great oceans\\nare studded.', 'I have taken pains to verify this assertion, and I have\\nfound it strictly true.', 'I have, however, been assured that a frog exists\\non the mountains of the great island of New Zealand; but I suspect that\\nthis exception (if the information be correct) may be explained through\\nglacial agency.', 'This general absence of frogs, toads, and newts on\\nso many oceanic islands cannot be accounted for by their physical\\nconditions; indeed it seems that islands are peculiarly well fitted for\\nthese animals; for frogs have been introduced into Madeira, the Azores,\\nand Mauritius, and have multiplied so as to become a nuisance.', 'But as\\nthese animals and their spawn are known to be immediately killed by\\nsea-water, on my view we can see that there would be great difficulty in\\ntheir transportal across the sea, and therefore why they do not exist on\\nany oceanic island.', 'But why, on the theory of creation, they should not\\nhave been created there, it would be very difficult to explain.', 'Mammals offer another and similar case.', 'I have carefully searched the\\noldest voyages, but have not finished my search; as yet I have not found\\na single instance, free from doubt, of a terrestrial mammal (excluding\\ndomesticated animals kept by the natives) inhabiting an island situated\\nabove 300 miles from a continent or great continental island; and\\nmany islands situated at a much less distance are equally barren.', 'The\\nFalkland Islands, which are inhabited by a wolf-like fox, come nearest\\nto an exception; but this group cannot be considered as oceanic, as it\\nlies on a bank connected with the mainland; moreover, icebergs formerly\\nbrought boulders to its western shores, and they may have formerly\\ntransported foxes, as so frequently now happens in the arctic regions.', 'Yet it cannot be said that small islands will not support small mammals,\\nfor they occur in many parts of the world on very small islands, if\\nclose to a continent; and hardly an island can be named on which our\\nsmaller quadrupeds have not become naturalised and greatly multiplied.', 'It cannot be said, on the ordinary view of creation, that there has\\nnot been time for the creation of mammals; many volcanic islands are\\nsufficiently ancient, as shown by the stupendous degradation which they\\nhave suffered and by their tertiary strata: there has also been time\\nfor the production of endemic species belonging to other classes; and on\\ncontinents it is thought that mammals appear and disappear at a quicker\\nrate than other and lower animals.', 'Though terrestrial mammals do not\\noccur on oceanic islands, aerial mammals do occur on almost every\\nisland.', 'New Zealand possesses two bats found nowhere else in the world:\\nNorfolk Island, the Viti Archipelago, the Bonin Islands, the Caroline\\nand Marianne Archipelagoes, and Mauritius, all possess their peculiar\\nbats.', 'Why, it may be asked, has the supposed creative force produced\\nbats and no other mammals on remote islands?', 'On my view this question\\ncan easily be answered; for no terrestrial mammal can be transported\\nacross a wide space of sea, but bats can fly across.', 'Bats have been seen\\nwandering by day far over the Atlantic Ocean; and two North American\\nspecies either regularly or occasionally visit Bermuda, at the distance\\nof 600 miles from the mainland.', 'I hear from Mr. Tomes, who has specially\\nstudied this family, that many of the same species have enormous ranges,\\nand are found on continents and on far distant islands.', 'Hence we have\\nonly to suppose that such wandering species have been modified through\\nnatural selection in their new homes in relation to their new position,\\nand we can understand the presence of endemic bats on islands, with the\\nabsence of all terrestrial mammals.', 'Besides the absence of terrestrial mammals in relation to the remoteness\\nof islands from continents, there is also a relation, to a certain\\nextent independent of distance, between the depth of the sea separating\\nan island from the neighbouring mainland, and the presence in both of\\nthe same mammiferous species or of allied species in a more or less\\nmodified condition.', 'Mr. Windsor Earl has made some striking observations\\non this head in regard to the great Malay Archipelago, which is\\ntraversed near Celebes by a space of deep ocean; and this space\\nseparates two widely distinct mammalian faunas.', 'On either side the\\nislands are situated on moderately deep submarine banks, and they are\\ninhabited by closely allied or identical quadrupeds.', \"No doubt some few\\nanomalies occur in this great archipelago, and there is much difficulty\\nin forming a judgment in some cases owing to the probable naturalisation\\nof certain mammals through man's agency; but we shall soon have much\\nlight thrown on the natural history of this archipelago by the admirable\\nzeal and researches of Mr. Wallace.\", 'I have not as yet had time to follow\\nup this subject in all other quarters of the world; but as far as I have\\ngone, the relation generally holds good.', 'We see Britain separated by a\\nshallow channel from Europe, and the mammals are the same on both\\nsides; we meet with analogous facts on many islands separated by similar\\nchannels from Australia.', 'The West Indian Islands stand on a deeply\\nsubmerged bank, nearly 1000 fathoms in depth, and here we find American\\nforms, but the species and even the genera are distinct.', 'As the amount\\nof modification in all cases depends to a certain degree on the lapse\\nof time, and as during changes of level it is obvious that islands\\nseparated by shallow channels are more likely to have been continuously\\nunited within a recent period to the mainland than islands separated\\nby deeper channels, we can understand the frequent relation between the\\ndepth of the sea and the degree of affinity of the mammalian inhabitants\\nof islands with those of a neighbouring continent,--an inexplicable\\nrelation on the view of independent acts of creation.', 'All the foregoing remarks on the inhabitants of oceanic\\nislands,--namely, the scarcity of kinds--the richness in endemic forms\\nin particular classes or sections of classes,--the absence of whole\\ngroups, as of batrachians, and of terrestrial mammals notwithstanding\\nthe presence of aerial bats,--the singular proportions of certain\\norders of plants,--herbaceous forms having been developed into trees,\\netc.,--seem to me to accord better with the view of occasional means of\\ntransport having been largely efficient in the long course of time, than\\nwith the view of all our oceanic islands having been formerly connected\\nby continuous land with the nearest continent; for on this latter\\nview the migration would probably have been more complete; and if\\nmodification be admitted, all the forms of life would have been more\\nequally modified, in accordance with the paramount importance of the\\nrelation of organism to organism.', 'I do not deny that there are many and grave difficulties in\\nunderstanding how several of the inhabitants of the more remote islands,\\nwhether still retaining the same specific form or modified since their\\narrival, could have reached their present homes.', 'But the probability of\\nmany islands having existed as halting-places, of which not a wreck now\\nremains, must not be overlooked.', 'I will here give a single instance of\\none of the cases of difficulty.', 'Almost all oceanic islands, even the\\nmost isolated and smallest, are inhabited by land-shells, generally by\\nendemic species, but sometimes by species found elsewhere.', 'Dr. Aug. A.\\nGould has given several interesting cases in regard to the land-shells\\nof the islands of the Pacific.', 'Now it is notorious that land-shells are\\nvery easily killed by salt; their eggs, at least such as I have tried,\\nsink in sea-water and are killed by it.', 'Yet there must be, on my view,\\nsome unknown, but highly efficient means for their transportal.', 'Would\\nthe just-hatched young occasionally crawl on and adhere to the feet of\\nbirds roosting on the ground, and thus get transported?', 'It occurred to\\nme that land-shells, when hybernating and having a membranous diaphragm\\nover the mouth of the shell, might be floated in chinks of drifted\\ntimber across moderately wide arms of the sea.', 'And I found that several\\nspecies did in this state withstand uninjured an immersion in sea-water\\nduring seven days: one of these shells was the Helix pomatia, and after\\nit had again hybernated I put it in sea-water for twenty days, and it\\nperfectly recovered.', 'As this species has a thick calcareous operculum,\\nI removed it, and when it had formed a new membranous one, I immersed it\\nfor fourteen days in sea-water, and it recovered and crawled away:\\nbut more experiments are wanted on this head.', 'The most striking and\\nimportant fact for us in regard to the inhabitants of islands, is their\\naffinity to those of the nearest mainland, without being actually the\\nsame species.', 'Numerous instances could be given of this fact.', 'I will\\ngive only one, that of the Galapagos Archipelago, situated under the\\nequator, between 500 and 600 miles from the shores of South America.', 'Here almost every product of the land and water bears the unmistakeable\\nstamp of the American continent.', 'There are twenty-six land birds,\\nand twenty-five of these are ranked by Mr. Gould as distinct species,\\nsupposed to have been created here; yet the close affinity of most of\\nthese birds to American species in every character, in their habits,\\ngestures, and tones of voice, was manifest.', 'So it is with the other\\nanimals, and with nearly all the plants, as shown by Dr. Hooker in\\nhis admirable memoir on the Flora of this archipelago.', 'The naturalist,\\nlooking at the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in the Pacific,\\ndistant several hundred miles from the continent, yet feels that he is\\nstanding on American land.', 'Why should this be so?', 'why should the species\\nwhich are supposed to have been created in the Galapagos Archipelago,\\nand nowhere else, bear so plain a stamp of affinity to those created in\\nAmerica?', 'There is nothing in the conditions of life, in the geological\\nnature of the islands, in their height or climate, or in the proportions\\nin which the several classes are associated together, which resembles\\nclosely the conditions of the South American coast: in fact there is\\na considerable dissimilarity in all these respects.', 'On the other hand,\\nthere is a considerable degree of resemblance in the volcanic nature\\nof the soil, in climate, height, and size of the islands, between\\nthe Galapagos and Cape de Verde Archipelagos: but what an entire and\\nabsolute difference in their inhabitants!', 'The inhabitants of the Cape\\nde Verde Islands are related to those of Africa, like those of the\\nGalapagos to America.', 'I believe this grand fact can receive no sort of\\nexplanation on the ordinary view of independent creation; whereas on the\\nview here maintained, it is obvious that the Galapagos Islands would be\\nlikely to receive colonists, whether by occasional means of transport or\\nby formerly continuous land, from America; and the Cape de Verde\\nIslands from Africa; and that such colonists would be liable to\\nmodification;--the principle of inheritance still betraying their\\noriginal birthplace.', 'Many analogous facts could be given: indeed it is an almost universal\\nrule that the endemic productions of islands are related to those of the\\nnearest continent, or of other near islands.', 'The exceptions are few, and\\nmost of them can be explained.', \"Thus the plants of Kerguelen Land, though\\nstanding nearer to Africa than to America, are related, and that very\\nclosely, as we know from Dr. Hooker's account, to those of America: but\\non the view that this island has been mainly stocked by seeds brought\\nwith earth and stones on icebergs, drifted by the prevailing currents,\\nthis anomaly disappears.\", 'New Zealand in its endemic plants is much more\\nclosely related to Australia, the nearest mainland, than to any other\\nregion: and this is what might have been expected; but it is also\\nplainly related to South America, which, although the next nearest\\ncontinent, is so enormously remote, that the fact becomes an anomaly.', 'But this difficulty almost disappears on the view that both New Zealand,\\nSouth America, and other southern lands were long ago partially stocked\\nfrom a nearly intermediate though distant point, namely from the\\nantarctic islands, when they were clothed with vegetation, before the\\ncommencement of the Glacial period.', 'The affinity, which, though\\nfeeble, I am assured by Dr. Hooker is real, between the flora of the\\nsouth-western corner of Australia and of the Cape of Good Hope, is a far\\nmore remarkable case, and is at present inexplicable: but this affinity\\nis confined to the plants, and will, I do not doubt, be some day\\nexplained.', 'The law which causes the inhabitants of an archipelago, though\\nspecifically distinct, to be closely allied to those of the nearest\\ncontinent, we sometimes see displayed on a small scale, yet in a most\\ninteresting manner, within the limits of the same archipelago.', 'Thus the\\nseveral islands of the Galapagos Archipelago are tenanted, as I have\\nelsewhere shown, in a quite marvellous manner, by very closely related\\nspecies; so that the inhabitants of each separate island, though mostly\\ndistinct, are related in an incomparably closer degree to each other\\nthan to the inhabitants of any other part of the world.', 'And this is just\\nwhat might have been expected on my view, for the islands are situated\\nso near each other that they would almost certainly receive\\nimmigrants from the same original source, or from each other.', 'But this\\ndissimilarity between the endemic inhabitants of the islands may be\\nused as an argument against my views; for it may be asked, how has it\\nhappened in the several islands situated within sight of each other,\\nhaving the same geological nature, the same height, climate, etc., that\\nmany of the immigrants should have been differently modified, though\\nonly in a small degree.', 'This long appeared to me a great difficulty: but\\nit arises in chief part from the deeply-seated error of considering\\nthe physical conditions of a country as the most important for its\\ninhabitants; whereas it cannot, I think, be disputed that the nature of\\nthe other inhabitants, with which each has to compete, is at least as\\nimportant, and generally a far more important element of success.', 'Now\\nif we look to those inhabitants of the Galapagos Archipelago which are\\nfound in other parts of the world (laying on one side for the moment\\nthe endemic species, which cannot be here fairly included, as we are\\nconsidering how they have come to be modified since their arrival), we\\nfind a considerable amount of difference in the several islands.', 'This\\ndifference might indeed have been expected on the view of the islands\\nhaving been stocked by occasional means of transport--a seed, for\\ninstance, of one plant having been brought to one island, and that of\\nanother plant to another island.', 'Hence when in former times an immigrant\\nsettled on any one or more of the islands, or when it subsequently\\nspread from one island to another, it would undoubtedly be exposed to\\ndifferent conditions of life in the different islands, for it would\\nhave to compete with different sets of organisms: a plant, for instance,\\nwould find the best-fitted ground more perfectly occupied by distinct\\nplants in one island than in another, and it would be exposed to the\\nattacks of somewhat different enemies.', 'If then it varied, natural\\nselection would probably favour different varieties in the different\\nislands.', 'Some species, however, might spread and yet retain the same\\ncharacter throughout the group, just as we see on continents some\\nspecies spreading widely and remaining the same.', 'The really surprising fact in this case of the Galapagos Archipelago,\\nand in a lesser degree in some analogous instances, is that the new\\nspecies formed in the separate islands have not quickly spread to the\\nother islands.', 'But the islands, though in sight of each other, are\\nseparated by deep arms of the sea, in most cases wider than the British\\nChannel, and there is no reason to suppose that they have at any former\\nperiod been continuously united.', 'The currents of the sea are rapid and\\nsweep across the archipelago, and gales of wind are extraordinarily\\nrare; so that the islands are far more effectually separated from each\\nother than they appear to be on a map.', 'Nevertheless a good many species,\\nboth those found in other parts of the world and those confined to the\\narchipelago, are common to the several islands, and we may infer from\\ncertain facts that these have probably spread from some one island\\nto the others.', \"But we often take, I think, an erroneous view of the\\nprobability of closely allied species invading each other's territory,\\nwhen put into free intercommunication.\", 'Undoubtedly if one species has\\nany advantage whatever over another, it will in a very brief time wholly\\nor in part supplant it; but if both are equally well fitted for their\\nown places in nature, both probably will hold their own places and keep\\nseparate for almost any length of time.', \"Being familiar with the fact\\nthat many species, naturalised through man's agency, have spread with\\nastonishing rapidity over new countries, we are apt to infer that most\\nspecies would thus spread; but we should remember that the forms which\\nbecome naturalised in new countries are not generally closely allied to\\nthe aboriginal inhabitants, but are very distinct species, belonging in\\na large proportion of cases, as shown by Alph.\", 'de Candolle, to distinct\\ngenera.', 'In the Galapagos Archipelago, many even of the birds, though\\nso well adapted for flying from island to island, are distinct on each;\\nthus there are three closely-allied species of mocking-thrush, each\\nconfined to its own island.', 'Now let us suppose the mocking-thrush\\nof Chatham Island to be blown to Charles Island, which has its own\\nmocking-thrush: why should it succeed in establishing itself there?', 'We may safely infer that Charles Island is well stocked with its own\\nspecies, for annually more eggs are laid there than can possibly be\\nreared; and we may infer that the mocking-thrush peculiar to Charles\\nIsland is at least as well fitted for its home as is the species\\npeculiar to Chatham Island.', 'Sir C. Lyell and Mr. Wollaston have\\ncommunicated to me a remarkable fact bearing on this subject; namely,\\nthat Madeira and the adjoining islet of Porto Santo possess many\\ndistinct but representative land-shells, some of which live in\\ncrevices of stone; and although large quantities of stone are annually\\ntransported from Porto Santo to Madeira, yet this latter island has not\\nbecome colonised by the Porto Santo species: nevertheless both islands\\nhave been colonised by some European land-shells, which no doubt had\\nsome advantage over the indigenous species.', 'From these considerations\\nI think we need not greatly marvel at the endemic and representative\\nspecies, which inhabit the several islands of the Galapagos Archipelago,\\nnot having universally spread from island to island.', 'In many other\\ninstances, as in the several districts of the same continent,\\npre-occupation has probably played an important part in checking the\\ncommingling of species under the same conditions of life.', 'Thus, the\\nsouth-east and south-west corners of Australia have nearly the same\\nphysical conditions, and are united by continuous land, yet they are\\ninhabited by a vast number of distinct mammals, birds, and plants.', 'The principle which determines the general character of the fauna\\nand flora of oceanic islands, namely, that the inhabitants, when not\\nidentically the same, yet are plainly related to the inhabitants of\\nthat region whence colonists could most readily have been derived,--the\\ncolonists having been subsequently modified and better fitted to their\\nnew homes,--is of the widest application throughout nature.', 'We see\\nthis on every mountain, in every lake and marsh.', 'For Alpine species,\\nexcepting in so far as the same forms, chiefly of plants, have spread\\nwidely throughout the world during the recent Glacial epoch, are related\\nto those of the surrounding lowlands;--thus we have in South America,\\nAlpine humming-birds, Alpine rodents, Alpine plants, etc., all of\\nstrictly American forms, and it is obvious that a mountain, as it became\\nslowly upheaved, would naturally be colonised from the surrounding\\nlowlands.', 'So it is with the inhabitants of lakes and marshes, excepting\\nin so far as great facility of transport has given the same general\\nforms to the whole world.', 'We see this same principle in the blind\\nanimals inhabiting the caves of America and of Europe.', 'Other analogous\\nfacts could be given.', 'And it will, I believe, be universally found to\\nbe true, that wherever in two regions, let them be ever so distant, many\\nclosely allied or representative species occur, there will likewise be\\nfound some identical species, showing, in accordance with the foregoing\\nview, that at some former period there has been intercommunication or\\nmigration between the two regions.', 'And wherever many closely-allied\\nspecies occur, there will be found many forms which some naturalists\\nrank as distinct species, and some as varieties; these doubtful forms\\nshowing us the steps in the process of modification.', 'This relation between the power and extent of migration of a species,\\neither at the present time or at some former period under different\\nphysical conditions, and the existence at remote points of the world of\\nother species allied to it, is shown in another and more general way.', 'Mr. Gould remarked to me long ago, that in those genera of birds which\\nrange over the world, many of the species have very wide ranges.', 'I\\ncan hardly doubt that this rule is generally true, though it would be\\ndifficult to prove it.', 'Amongst mammals, we see it strikingly displayed\\nin Bats, and in a lesser degree in the Felidae and Canidae.', 'We see it,\\nif we compare the distribution of butterflies and beetles.', 'So it is with\\nmost fresh-water productions, in which so many genera range over the\\nworld, and many individual species have enormous ranges.', 'It is not meant\\nthat in world-ranging genera all the species have a wide range, or even\\nthat they have on an AVERAGE a wide range; but only that some of the\\nspecies range very widely; for the facility with which widely-ranging\\nspecies vary and give rise to new forms will largely determine their\\naverage range.', 'For instance, two varieties of the same species inhabit\\nAmerica and Europe, and the species thus has an immense range; but, if\\nthe variation had been a little greater, the two varieties would have\\nbeen ranked as distinct species, and the common range would have been\\ngreatly reduced.', 'Still less is it meant, that a species which apparently\\nhas the capacity of crossing barriers and ranging widely, as in the case\\nof certain powerfully-winged birds, will necessarily range widely; for\\nwe should never forget that to range widely implies not only the power\\nof crossing barriers, but the more important power of being victorious\\nin distant lands in the struggle for life with foreign associates.', 'But\\non the view of all the species of a genus having descended from a single\\nparent, though now distributed to the most remote points of the world,\\nwe ought to find, and I believe as a general rule we do find, that some\\nat least of the species range very widely; for it is necessary that the\\nunmodified parent should range widely, undergoing modification during\\nits diffusion, and should place itself under diverse conditions\\nfavourable for the conversion of its offspring, firstly into new\\nvarieties and ultimately into new species.', 'In considering the wide distribution of certain genera, we should bear\\nin mind that some are extremely ancient, and must have branched off from\\na common parent at a remote epoch; so that in such cases there will\\nhave been ample time for great climatal and geographical changes and for\\naccidents of transport; and consequently for the migration of some of\\nthe species into all quarters of the world, where they may have become\\nslightly modified in relation to their new conditions.', 'There is, also,\\nsome reason to believe from geological evidence that organisms low in\\nthe scale within each great class, generally change at a slower rate\\nthan the higher forms; and consequently the lower forms will have had a\\nbetter chance of ranging widely and of still retaining the same specific\\ncharacter.', 'This fact, together with the seeds and eggs of many low forms\\nbeing very minute and better fitted for distant transportation, probably\\naccounts for a law which has long been observed, and which has lately\\nbeen admirably discussed by Alph.', 'de Candolle in regard to plants,\\nnamely, that the lower any group of organisms is, the more widely it is\\napt to range.', 'The relations just discussed,--namely, low and slowly-changing\\norganisms ranging more widely than the high,--some of the species of\\nwidely-ranging genera themselves ranging widely,--such facts, as alpine,\\nlacustrine, and marsh productions being related (with the exceptions\\nbefore specified) to those on the surrounding low lands and dry lands,\\nthough these stations are so different--the very close relation of the\\ndistinct species which inhabit the islets of the same archipelago,--and\\nespecially the striking relation of the inhabitants of each whole\\narchipelago or island to those of the nearest mainland,--are, I think,\\nutterly inexplicable on the ordinary view of the independent creation\\nof each species, but are explicable on the view of colonisation from the\\nnearest and readiest source, together with the subsequent modification\\nand better adaptation of the colonists to their new homes.', 'SUMMARY OF LAST AND PRESENT CHAPTERS.', 'In these chapters I have endeavoured to show, that if we make due\\nallowance for our ignorance of the full effects of all the changes of\\nclimate and of the level of the land, which have certainly occurred\\nwithin the recent period, and of other similar changes which may have\\noccurred within the same period; if we remember how profoundly ignorant\\nwe are with respect to the many and curious means of occasional\\ntransport,--a subject which has hardly ever been properly experimentised\\non; if we bear in mind how often a species may have ranged continuously\\nover a wide area, and then have become extinct in the intermediate\\ntracts, I think the difficulties in believing that all the individuals\\nof the same species, wherever located, have descended from the same\\nparents, are not insuperable.', 'And we are led to this conclusion, which\\nhas been arrived at by many naturalists under the designation of single\\ncentres of creation, by some general considerations, more especially\\nfrom the importance of barriers and from the analogical distribution of\\nsub-genera, genera, and families.', 'With respect to the distinct species of the same genus, which on my\\ntheory must have spread from one parent-source; if we make the same\\nallowances as before for our ignorance, and remember that some forms of\\nlife change most slowly, enormous periods of time being thus granted for\\ntheir migration, I do not think that the difficulties are insuperable;\\nthough they often are in this case, and in that of the individuals of\\nthe same species, extremely grave.', 'As exemplifying the effects of climatal changes on distribution, I have\\nattempted to show how important has been the influence of the modern\\nGlacial period, which I am fully convinced simultaneously affected\\nthe whole world, or at least great meridional belts.', 'As showing how\\ndiversified are the means of occasional transport, I have discussed at\\nsome little length the means of dispersal of fresh-water productions.', 'If the difficulties be not insuperable in admitting that in the long\\ncourse of time the individuals of the same species, and likewise of\\nallied species, have proceeded from some one source; then I think all\\nthe grand leading facts of geographical distribution are explicable on\\nthe theory of migration (generally of the more dominant forms of life),\\ntogether with subsequent modification and the multiplication of new\\nforms.', 'We can thus understand the high importance of barriers, whether\\nof land or water, which separate our several zoological and botanical\\nprovinces.', 'We can thus understand the localisation of sub-genera,\\ngenera, and families; and how it is that under different latitudes, for\\ninstance in South America, the inhabitants of the plains and mountains,\\nof the forests, marshes, and deserts, are in so mysterious a manner\\nlinked together by affinity, and are likewise linked to the extinct\\nbeings which formerly inhabited the same continent.', 'Bearing in mind\\nthat the mutual relations of organism to organism are of the highest\\nimportance, we can see why two areas having nearly the same physical\\nconditions should often be inhabited by very different forms of\\nlife; for according to the length of time which has elapsed since\\nnew inhabitants entered one region; according to the nature of the\\ncommunication which allowed certain forms and not others to enter,\\neither in greater or lesser numbers; according or not, as those which\\nentered happened to come in more or less direct competition with each\\nother and with the aborigines; and according as the immigrants were\\ncapable of varying more or less rapidly, there would ensue in different\\nregions, independently of their physical conditions, infinitely\\ndiversified conditions of life,--there would be an almost endless amount\\nof organic action and reaction,--and we should find, as we do find,\\nsome groups of beings greatly, and some only slightly modified,--some\\ndeveloped in great force, some existing in scanty numbers--in the\\ndifferent great geographical provinces of the world.', 'On these same principles, we can understand, as I have endeavoured to\\nshow, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but of these a\\ngreat number should be endemic or peculiar; and why, in relation to the\\nmeans of migration, one group of beings, even within the same class,\\nshould have all its species endemic, and another group should have all\\nits species common to other quarters of the world.', 'We can see why whole\\ngroups of organisms, as batrachians and terrestrial mammals, should be\\nabsent from oceanic islands, whilst the most isolated islands possess\\ntheir own peculiar species of aerial mammals or bats.', 'We can see why\\nthere should be some relation between the presence of mammals, in a more\\nor less modified condition, and the depth of the sea between an island\\nand the mainland.', 'We can clearly see why all the inhabitants of an\\narchipelago, though specifically distinct on the several islets, should\\nbe closely related to each other, and likewise be related, but less\\nclosely, to those of the nearest continent or other source whence\\nimmigrants were probably derived.', 'We can see why in two areas, however\\ndistant from each other, there should be a correlation, in the presence\\nof identical species, of varieties, of doubtful species, and of distinct\\nbut representative species.', 'As the late Edward Forbes often insisted, there is a striking\\nparallelism in the laws of life throughout time and space: the laws\\ngoverning the succession of forms in past times being nearly the same\\nwith those governing at the present time the differences in different\\nareas.', 'We see this in many facts.', 'The endurance of each species and\\ngroup of species is continuous in time; for the exceptions to the rule\\nare so few, that they may fairly be attributed to our not having as\\nyet discovered in an intermediate deposit the forms which are therein\\nabsent, but which occur above and below: so in space, it certainly is\\nthe general rule that the area inhabited by a single species, or by a\\ngroup of species, is continuous; and the exceptions, which are not rare,\\nmay, as I have attempted to show, be accounted for by migration at\\nsome former period under different conditions or by occasional means of\\ntransport, and by the species having become extinct in the intermediate\\ntracts.', 'Both in time and space, species and groups of species have their\\npoints of maximum development.', 'Groups of species, belonging either to a\\ncertain period of time, or to a certain area, are often characterised by\\ntrifling characters in common, as of sculpture or colour.', 'In looking\\nto the long succession of ages, as in now looking to distant provinces\\nthroughout the world, we find that some organisms differ little, whilst\\nothers belonging to a different class, or to a different order, or even\\nonly to a different family of the same order, differ greatly.', 'In both\\ntime and space the lower members of each class generally change less\\nthan the higher; but there are in both cases marked exceptions to the\\nrule.', 'On my theory these several relations throughout time and space\\nare intelligible; for whether we look to the forms of life which have\\nchanged during successive ages within the same quarter of the world, or\\nto those which have changed after having migrated into distant quarters,\\nin both cases the forms within each class have been connected by the\\nsame bond of ordinary generation; and the more nearly any two forms are\\nrelated in blood, the nearer they will generally stand to each other in\\ntime and space; in both cases the laws of variation have been the same,\\nand modifications have been accumulated by the same power of natural\\nselection.', '13.', 'MUTUAL AFFINITIES OF ORGANIC BEINGS: MORPHOLOGY:\\nEMBRYOLOGY: RUDIMENTARY ORGANS.', 'CLASSIFICATION, groups subordinate to groups.', 'Natural system.', 'Rules and\\ndifficulties in classification, explained on the theory of descent\\nwith modification.', 'Classification of varieties.', 'Descent always used in\\nclassification.', 'Analogical or adaptive characters.', 'Affinities, general,\\ncomplex and radiating.', 'Extinction separates and defines groups.', 'MORPHOLOGY, between members of the same class, between parts of the same\\nindividual.', 'EMBRYOLOGY, laws of, explained by variations not supervening\\nat an early age, and being inherited at a corresponding age.', 'RUDIMENTARY\\nORGANS;

St. Hilaire.', 'If certain characters are always found correlated with others, though\\nno apparent bond of connexion can be discovered between them, especial\\nvalue is set on them.', 'As in most groups of animals, important organs,\\nsuch as those for propelling the blood, or for aerating it, or those for\\npropagating the race, are found nearly uniform, they are considered as\\nhighly serviceable in classification; but in some groups of animals all\\nthese, the most important vital organs, are found to offer characters of\\nquite subordinate value.', 'We can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of equal\\nimportance with those derived from the adult, for our classifications of\\ncourse include all ages of each species.', 'But it is by no means obvious,\\non the ordinary view, why the structure of the embryo should be more\\nimportant for this purpose than that of the adult, which alone plays its\\nfull part in the economy of nature.', 'Yet it has been strongly urged\\nby those great naturalists, Milne Edwards and Agassiz, that embryonic\\ncharacters are the most important of any in the classification of\\nanimals; and this doctrine has very generally been admitted as true.', 'The same fact holds good with flowering plants, of which the two main\\ndivisions have been founded on characters derived from the embryo,--on\\nthe number and position of the embryonic leaves or cotyledons, and on\\nthe mode of development of the plumule and radicle.', 'In our discussion\\non embryology, we shall see why such characters are so valuable, on the\\nview of classification tacitly including the idea of descent.', 'Our classifications are often plainly influenced by chains of\\naffinities.', 'Nothing can be easier than to define a number of characters\\ncommon to all birds; but in the case of crustaceans, such definition has\\nhitherto been found impossible.', 'There are crustaceans at the opposite\\nends of the series, which have hardly a character in common; yet the\\nspecies at both ends, from being plainly allied to others, and these to\\nothers, and so onwards, can be recognised as unequivocally belonging to\\nthis, and to no other class of the Articulata.', 'Geographical distribution has often been used, though perhaps not quite\\nlogically, in classification, more especially in very large groups of\\nclosely allied forms.', 'Temminck insists on the utility or even necessity\\nof this practice in certain groups of birds; and it has been followed by\\nseveral entomologists and botanists.', 'Finally, with respect to the comparative value of the various groups of\\nspecies, such as orders, sub-orders, families, sub-families, and genera,\\nthey seem to be, at least at present, almost arbitrary.', 'Several of the\\nbest botanists, such as Mr. Bentham and others, have strongly insisted\\non their arbitrary value.', 'Instances could be given amongst plants and\\ninsects, of a group of forms, first ranked by practised naturalists as\\nonly a genus, and then raised to the rank of a sub-family or family; and\\nthis has been done, not because further research has detected important\\nstructural differences, at first overlooked, but because numerous\\nallied species, with slightly different grades of difference, have been\\nsubsequently discovered.', 'All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification\\nare explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that\\nthe natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the\\ncharacters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between\\nany two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a\\ncommon parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical;\\nthat community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been\\nunconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation, or the\\nenunciation of general propositions, and the mere putting together and\\nseparating objects more or less alike.', 'But I must explain my meaning more fully.', 'I believe that the ARRANGEMENT\\nof the groups within each class, in due subordination and relation to\\nthe other groups, must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural;\\nbut that the AMOUNT of difference in the several branches or groups,\\nthough allied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor,\\nmay differ greatly, being due to the different degrees of modification\\nwhich they have undergone; and this is expressed by the forms being\\nranked under different genera, families, sections, or orders.', 'The reader\\nwill best understand what is meant, if he will take the trouble of\\nreferring to the diagram in the fourth chapter.', 'We will suppose the\\nletters A to L to represent allied genera, which lived during the\\nSilurian epoch, and these have descended from a species which existed at\\nan unknown anterior period.', 'Species of three of these genera (A, F, and\\nI) have transmitted modified descendants to the present day, represented\\nby the fifteen genera (a14 to z14) on the uppermost horizontal line.', 'Now\\nall these modified descendants from a single species, are represented as\\nrelated in blood or descent to the same degree; they may metaphorically\\nbe called cousins to the same millionth degree; yet they differ widely\\nand in different degrees from each other.', 'The forms descended from A,\\nnow broken up into two or three families, constitute a distinct order\\nfrom those descended from I, also broken up into two families.', 'Nor can\\nthe existing species, descended from A, be ranked in the same genus with\\nthe parent A; or those from I, with the parent I.', 'But the existing genus\\nF14 may be supposed to have been but slightly modified; and it will\\nthen rank with the parent-genus F; just as some few still living organic\\nbeings belong to Silurian genera.', 'So that the amount or value of the\\ndifferences between organic beings all related to each other in the same\\ndegree in blood, has come to be widely different.', 'Nevertheless their\\ngenealogical ARRANGEMENT remains strictly true, not only at the present\\ntime, but at each successive period of descent.', 'All the modified\\ndescendants from A will have inherited something in common from their\\ncommon parent, as will all the descendants from I; so will it be with\\neach subordinate branch of descendants, at each successive period.', 'If,\\nhowever, we choose to suppose that any of the descendants of A or of\\nI have been so much modified as to have more or less completely lost\\ntraces of their parentage, in this case, their places in a natural\\nclassification will have been more or less completely lost,--as\\nsometimes seems to have occurred with existing organisms.', 'All the\\ndescendants of the genus F, along its whole line of descent, are\\nsupposed to have been but little modified, and they yet form a single\\ngenus.', 'But this genus, though much isolated, will still occupy its\\nproper intermediate position; for F originally was intermediate in\\ncharacter between A and I, and the several genera descended from these\\ntwo genera will have inherited to a certain extent their characters.', 'This natural arrangement is shown, as far as is possible on paper, in\\nthe diagram, but in much too simple a manner.', 'If a branching diagram had\\nnot been used, and only the names of the groups had been written in a\\nlinear series, it would have been still less possible to have given a\\nnatural arrangement; and it is notoriously not possible to represent in\\na series, on a flat surface, the affinities which we discover in nature\\namongst the beings of the same group.', 'Thus, on the view which I hold,\\nthe natural system is genealogical in its arrangement, like a pedigree;\\nbut the degrees of modification which the different groups have\\nundergone, have to be expressed by ranking them under different\\nso-called genera, sub-families, families, sections, orders, and classes.', 'It may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification, by\\ntaking the case of languages.', 'If we possessed a perfect pedigree of\\nmankind, a genealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford the\\nbest classification of the various languages now spoken throughout the\\nworld; and if all extinct languages, and all intermediate and slowly\\nchanging dialects, had to be included, such an arrangement would, I\\nthink, be the only possible one.', 'Yet it might be that some very ancient\\nlanguage had altered little, and had given rise to few new languages,\\nwhilst others (owing to the spreading and subsequent isolation and\\nstates of civilisation of the several races, descended from a common\\nrace) had altered much, and had given rise to many new languages and\\ndialects.', 'The various degrees of difference in the languages from the\\nsame stock, would have to be expressed by groups subordinate to\\ngroups; but the proper or even only possible arrangement would still be\\ngenealogical; and this would be strictly natural, as it would connect\\ntogether all languages, extinct and modern, by the closest affinities,\\nand would give the filiation and origin of each tongue.', 'In confirmation of this view, let us glance at the classification\\nof varieties, which are believed or known to have descended from one\\nspecies.', 'These are grouped under species, with sub-varieties under\\nvarieties; and with our domestic productions, several other grades of\\ndifference are requisite, as we have seen with pigeons.', 'The origin\\nof the existence of groups subordinate to groups, is the same with\\nvarieties as with species, namely, closeness of descent with various\\ndegrees of modification.', 'Nearly the same rules are followed in\\nclassifying varieties, as with species.', 'Authors have insisted on the\\nnecessity of classing varieties on a natural instead of an artificial\\nsystem; we are cautioned, for instance, not to class two varieties of\\nthe pine-apple together, merely because their fruit, though the most\\nimportant part, happens to be nearly identical; no one puts the swedish\\nand common turnips together, though the esculent and thickened stems\\nare so similar.', 'Whatever part is found to be most constant, is used in\\nclassing varieties: thus the great agriculturist Marshall says the horns\\nare very useful for this purpose with cattle, because they are less\\nvariable than the shape or colour of the body, etc.', '; whereas with sheep\\nthe horns are much less serviceable, because less constant.', 'In classing\\nvarieties, I apprehend if we had a real pedigree, a genealogical\\nclassification would be universally preferred; and it has been attempted\\nby some authors.', 'For we might feel sure, whether there had been more\\nor less modification, the principle of inheritance would keep the forms\\ntogether which were allied in the greatest number of points.', 'In tumbler\\npigeons, though some sub-varieties differ from the others in the\\nimportant character of having a longer beak, yet all are kept together\\nfrom having the common habit of tumbling; but the short-faced breed has\\nnearly or quite lost this habit; nevertheless, without any reasoning\\nor thinking on the subject, these tumblers are kept in the same group,\\nbecause allied in blood and alike in some other respects.', 'If it could be\\nproved that the Hottentot had descended from the Negro, I think he would\\nbe classed under the Negro group, however much he might differ in colour\\nand other important characters from negroes.', 'With species in a state of nature, every naturalist has in fact brought\\ndescent into his classification; for he includes in his lowest grade,\\nor that of a species, the two sexes; and how enormously these sometimes\\ndiffer in the most important characters, is known to every naturalist:\\nscarcely a single fact can be predicated in common of the males and\\nhermaphrodites of certain cirripedes, when adult, and yet no one dreams\\nof separating them.', 'The naturalist includes as one species the several\\nlarval stages of the same individual, however much they may differ from\\neach other and from the adult; as he likewise includes the so-called\\nalternate generations of Steenstrup, which can only in a technical sense\\nbe considered as the same individual.', 'He includes monsters; he includes\\nvarieties, not solely because they closely resemble the parent-form, but\\nbecause they are descended from it.', 'He who believes that the cowslip\\nis descended from the primrose, or conversely, ranks them together as\\na single species, and gives a single definition.', 'As soon as three\\nOrchidean forms (Monochanthus, Myanthus, and Catasetum), which had\\npreviously been ranked as three distinct genera, were known to be\\nsometimes produced on the same spike, they were immediately included as\\na single species.', 'But it may be asked, what ought we to do, if it could\\nbe proved that one species of kangaroo had been produced, by a long\\ncourse of modification, from a bear?', 'Ought we to rank this one\\nspecies with bears, and what should we do with the other species?', 'The supposition is of course preposterous;

and only thus can I understand the several\\nrules and guides which have been followed by our best systematists.', 'We\\nhave no written pedigrees; we have to make out community of descent by\\nresemblances of any kind.', 'Therefore we choose those characters which,\\nas far as we can judge, are the least likely to have been modified\\nin relation to the conditions of life to which each species has been\\nrecently exposed.', 'Rudimentary structures on this view are as good as, or\\neven sometimes better than, other parts of the organisation.', \"We care not\\nhow trifling a character may be--let it be the mere inflection of\\nthe angle of the jaw, the manner in which an insect's wing is folded,\\nwhether the skin be covered by hair or feathers--if it prevail\\nthroughout many and different species, especially those having very\\ndifferent habits of life, it assumes high value; for we can account for\\nits presence in so many forms with such different habits, only by its\\ninheritance from a common parent.\", 'We may err in this respect in regard\\nto single points of structure, but when several characters, let them\\nbe ever so trifling, occur together throughout a large group of beings\\nhaving different habits, we may feel almost sure, on the theory of\\ndescent, that these characters have been inherited from a common\\nancestor.', 'And we know that such correlated or aggregated characters have\\nespecial value in classification.', 'We can understand why a species or a group of species may depart, in\\nseveral of its most important characteristics, from its allies, and yet\\nbe safely classed with them.', 'This may be safely done, and is often\\ndone, as long as a sufficient number of characters, let them be ever so\\nunimportant, betrays the hidden bond of community of descent.', 'Let two\\nforms have not a single character in common, yet if these extreme forms\\nare connected together by a chain of intermediate groups, we may at\\nonce infer their community of descent, and we put them all into the same\\nclass.', 'As we find organs of high physiological importance--those\\nwhich serve to preserve life under the most diverse conditions of\\nexistence--are generally the most constant, we attach especial value to\\nthem; but if these same organs, in another group or section of a\\ngroup, are found to differ much, we at once value them less in\\nour classification.', 'We shall hereafter, I think, clearly see why\\nembryological characters are of such high classificatory importance.', 'Geographical distribution may sometimes be brought usefully into play in\\nclassing large and widely-distributed genera, because all the species of\\nthe same genus, inhabiting any distinct and isolated region, have in all\\nprobability descended from the same parents.', 'We can understand, on these views, the very important distinction\\nbetween real affinities and analogical or adaptive resemblances.', 'Lamarck first called attention to this distinction, and he has been ably\\nfollowed by Macleay and others.', 'The resemblance, in the shape of the\\nbody and in the fin-like anterior limbs, between the dugong, which is a\\npachydermatous animal, and the whale, and between both these mammals and\\nfishes, is analogical.', 'Amongst insects there are innumerable instances:\\nthus Linnaeus, misled by external appearances, actually classed an\\nhomopterous insect as a moth.', 'We see something of the same kind even\\nin our domestic varieties, as in the thickened stems of the common and\\nswedish turnip.', 'The resemblance of the greyhound and racehorse is hardly\\nmore fanciful than the analogies which have been drawn by some authors\\nbetween very distinct animals.', 'On my view of characters being of real\\nimportance for classification, only in so far as they reveal descent, we\\ncan clearly understand why analogical or adaptive character, although of\\nthe utmost importance to the welfare of the being, are almost valueless\\nto the systematist.', 'For animals, belonging to two most distinct lines\\nof descent, may readily become adapted to similar conditions, and thus\\nassume a close external resemblance; but such resemblances will not\\nreveal--will rather tend to conceal their blood-relationship to their\\nproper lines of descent.', 'We can also understand the apparent paradox,\\nthat the very same characters are analogical when one class or order is\\ncompared with another, but give true affinities when the members of the\\nsame class or order are compared one with another: thus the shape of\\nthe body and fin-like limbs are only analogical when whales are compared\\nwith fishes, being adaptations in both classes for swimming through the\\nwater; but the shape of the body and fin-like limbs serve as characters\\nexhibiting true affinity between the several members of the whale\\nfamily; for these cetaceans agree in so many characters, great and\\nsmall, that we cannot doubt that they have inherited their general shape\\nof body and structure of limbs from a common ancestor.', 'So it is with\\nfishes.', 'As members of distinct classes have often been adapted by successive\\nslight modifications to live under nearly similar circumstances,--to\\ninhabit for instance the three elements of land, air, and water,--we can\\nperhaps understand how it is that a numerical parallelism has sometimes\\nbeen observed between the sub-groups in distinct classes.', 'A naturalist,\\nstruck by a parallelism of this nature in any one class, by arbitrarily\\nraising or sinking the value of the groups in other classes (and all our\\nexperience shows that this valuation has hitherto been arbitrary), could\\neasily extend the parallelism over a wide range; and thus the septenary,\\nquinary, quaternary, and ternary classifications have probably arisen.', 'As the modified descendants of dominant species, belonging to the larger\\ngenera, tend to inherit the advantages, which made the groups to which\\nthey belong large and their parents dominant, they are almost sure to\\nspread widely, and to seize on more and more places in the economy\\nof nature.', 'The larger and more dominant groups thus tend to go on\\nincreasing in size; and they consequently supplant many smaller and\\nfeebler groups.', 'Thus we can account for the fact that all organisms,\\nrecent and extinct, are included under a few great orders, under still\\nfewer classes, and all in one great natural system.', 'As showing how\\nfew the higher groups are in number, and how widely spread they are\\nthroughout the world, the fact is striking, that the discovery of\\nAustralia has not added a single insect belonging to a new order; and\\nthat in the vegetable kingdom, as I learn from Dr. Hooker, it has added\\nonly two or three orders of small size.', 'In the chapter on geological succession I attempted to show, on the\\nprinciple of each group having generally diverged much in character\\nduring the long-continued process of modification, how it is that the\\nmore ancient forms of life often present characters in some slight\\ndegree intermediate between existing groups.', 'A few old and intermediate\\nparent-forms having occasionally transmitted to the present day\\ndescendants but little modified, will give to us our so-called osculant\\nor aberrant groups.', 'The more aberrant any form is, the greater must be\\nthe number of connecting forms which on my theory have been exterminated\\nand utterly lost.', 'And we have some evidence of aberrant forms having\\nsuffered severely from extinction, for they are generally represented by\\nextremely few species; and such species as do occur are generally very\\ndistinct from each other, which again implies extinction.', 'The genera\\nOrnithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, for example, would not have been less\\naberrant had each been represented by a dozen species instead of by\\na single one; but such richness in species, as I find after some\\ninvestigation, does not commonly fall to the lot of aberrant genera.', 'We\\ncan, I think, account for this fact only by looking at aberrant forms\\nas failing groups conquered by more successful competitors, with a\\nfew members preserved by some unusual coincidence of favourable\\ncircumstances.', 'Mr. Waterhouse has remarked that, when a member belonging to one group\\nof animals exhibits an affinity to a quite distinct group, this affinity\\nin most cases is general and not special: thus, according to Mr.\\nWaterhouse, of all Rodents, the bizcacha is most nearly related to\\nMarsupials; but in the points in which it approaches this order, its\\nrelations are general, and not to any one marsupial species more than\\nto another.', 'As the points of affinity of the bizcacha to Marsupials are\\nbelieved to be real and not merely adaptive, they are due on my theory\\nto inheritance in common.', 'Therefore we must suppose either that all\\nRodents, including the bizcacha, branched off from some very ancient\\nMarsupial, which will have had a character in some degree intermediate\\nwith respect to all existing Marsupials; or that both Rodents and\\nMarsupials branched off from a common progenitor, and that both groups\\nhave since undergone much modification in divergent directions.', 'On either view we may suppose that the bizcacha has retained, by\\ninheritance, more of the character of its ancient progenitor than have\\nother Rodents; and therefore it will not be specially related to any one\\nexisting Marsupial, but indirectly to all or nearly all Marsupials, from\\nhaving partially retained the character of their common progenitor, or\\nof an early member of the group.', 'On the other hand, of all Marsupials,\\nas Mr. Waterhouse has remarked, the phascolomys resembles most nearly,\\nnot any one species, but the general order of Rodents.', 'In this case,\\nhowever, it may be strongly suspected that the resemblance is only\\nanalogical, owing to the phascolomys having become adapted to habits\\nlike those of a Rodent.', 'The elder De Candolle has made nearly similar\\nobservations on the general nature of the affinities of distinct orders\\nof plants.', 'On the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in\\ncharacter of the species descended from a common parent, together with\\ntheir retention by inheritance of some characters in common, we can\\nunderstand the excessively complex and radiating affinities by which all\\nthe members of the same family or higher group are connected together.', 'For the common parent of a whole family of species, now broken up by\\nextinction into distinct groups and sub-groups, will have transmitted\\nsome of its characters, modified in various ways and degrees, to all;\\nand the several species will consequently be related to each other by\\ncircuitous lines of affinity of various lengths (as may be seen in the\\ndiagram so often referred to), mounting up through many predecessors.', 'As it is difficult to show the blood-relationship between the\\nnumerous kindred of any ancient and noble family, even by the aid of a\\ngenealogical tree, and almost impossible to do this without this aid,\\nwe can understand the extraordinary difficulty which naturalists have\\nexperienced in describing, without the aid of a diagram, the various\\naffinities which they perceive between the many living and extinct\\nmembers of the same great natural class.', 'Extinction, as we have seen in the fourth chapter, has played an\\nimportant part in defining and widening the intervals between the\\nseveral groups in each class.', 'We may thus account even for the\\ndistinctness of whole classes from each other--for instance, of birds\\nfrom all other vertebrate animals--by the belief that many ancient forms\\nof life have been utterly lost, through which the early progenitors of\\nbirds were formerly connected with the early progenitors of the other\\nvertebrate classes.', 'There has been less entire extinction of the forms\\nof life which once connected fishes with batrachians.', 'There has been\\nstill less in some other classes, as in that of the Crustacea, for here\\nthe most wonderfully diverse forms are still tied together by a long,\\nbut broken, chain of affinities.', 'Extinction has only separated groups:\\nit has by no means made them; for if every form which has ever lived\\non this earth were suddenly to reappear, though it would be\\nquite impossible to give definitions by which each group could be\\ndistinguished from other groups, as all would blend together by steps\\nas fine as those between the finest existing varieties, nevertheless\\na natural classification, or at least a natural arrangement, would be\\npossible.', 'We shall see this by turning to the diagram: the letters, A\\nto L, may represent eleven Silurian genera, some of which have produced\\nlarge groups of modified descendants.', 'Every intermediate link between\\nthese eleven genera and their primordial parent, and every intermediate\\nlink in each branch and sub-branch of their descendants, may be supposed\\nto be still alive; and the links to be as fine as those between the\\nfinest varieties.', 'In this case it would be quite impossible to give any\\ndefinition by which the several members of the several groups could be\\ndistinguished from their more immediate parents; or these parents from\\ntheir ancient and unknown progenitor.', 'Yet the natural arrangement in the\\ndiagram would still hold good; and, on the principle of inheritance, all\\nthe forms descended from A, or from I, would have something in common.', 'In a tree we can specify this or that branch, though at the actual fork\\nthe two unite and blend together.', 'We could not, as I have said, define\\nthe several groups; but we could pick out types, or forms, representing\\nmost of the characters of each group, whether large or small, and thus\\ngive a general idea of the value of the differences between them.', 'This\\nis what we should be driven to, if we were ever to succeed in collecting\\nall the forms in any class which have lived throughout all time\\nand space.', 'We shall certainly never succeed in making so perfect a\\ncollection: nevertheless, in certain classes, we are tending in this\\ndirection; and Milne Edwards has lately insisted, in an able paper, on\\nthe high importance of looking to types, whether or not we can separate\\nand define the groups to which such types belong.', 'Finally, we have seen that natural selection, which results from the\\nstruggle for existence, and which almost inevitably induces extinction\\nand divergence of character in the many descendants from one dominant\\nparent-species, explains that great and universal feature in the\\naffinities of all organic beings, namely, their subordination in group\\nunder group.', 'We use the element of descent in classing the individuals\\nof both sexes and of all ages, although having few characters in common,\\nunder one species; we use descent in classing acknowledged varieties,\\nhowever different they may be from their parent; and I believe this\\nelement of descent is the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists\\nhave sought under the term of the Natural System.', 'On this idea of the\\nnatural system being, in so far as it has been perfected, genealogical\\nin its arrangement, with the grades of difference between the\\ndescendants from a common parent, expressed by the terms genera,\\nfamilies, orders, etc., we can understand the rules which we are\\ncompelled to follow in our classification.', 'We can understand why we\\nvalue certain resemblances far more than others; why we are permitted to\\nuse rudimentary and useless organs, or others of trifling physiological\\nimportance; why, in comparing one group with a distinct group, we\\nsummarily reject analogical or adaptive characters, and yet use these\\nsame characters within the limits of the same group.', 'We can clearly see\\nhow it is that all living and extinct forms can be grouped together\\nin one great system;

or a webbed foot might have all its bones, or certain\\nbones, lengthened to any extent, and the membrane connecting them\\nincreased to any extent, so as to serve as a wing: yet in all this great\\namount of modification there will be no tendency to alter the framework\\nof bones or the relative connexion of the several parts.', 'If we suppose\\nthat the ancient progenitor, the archetype as it may be called, of all\\nmammals, had its limbs constructed on the existing general pattern,\\nfor whatever purpose they served, we can at once perceive the plain\\nsignification of the homologous construction of the limbs throughout the\\nwhole class.', 'So with the mouths of insects, we have only to suppose that\\ntheir common progenitor had an upper lip, mandibles, and two pair\\nof maxillae, these parts being perhaps very simple in form; and then\\nnatural selection will account for the infinite diversity in structure\\nand function of the mouths of insects.', 'Nevertheless, it is conceivable\\nthat the general pattern of an organ might become so much obscured as to\\nbe finally lost, by the atrophy and ultimately by the complete abortion\\nof certain parts, by the soldering together of other parts, and by the\\ndoubling or multiplication of others,--variations which we know to be\\nwithin the limits of possibility.', 'In the paddles of the extinct gigantic\\nsea-lizards, and in the mouths of certain suctorial crustaceans, the\\ngeneral pattern seems to have been thus to a certain extent obscured.', 'There is another and equally curious branch of the present subject;\\nnamely, the comparison not of the same part in different members of a\\nclass, but of the different parts or organs in the same individual.', 'Most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous\\nwith--that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with--the\\nelemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae.', 'The anterior and\\nposterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes\\nare plainly homologous.', 'We see the same law in comparing the wonderfully\\ncomplex jaws and legs in crustaceans.', 'It is familiar to almost every\\none, that in a flower the relative position of the sepals, petals,\\nstamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate structure, are\\nintelligible on the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves,\\narranged in a spire.', 'In monstrous plants, we often get direct evidence\\nof the possibility of one organ being transformed into another; and we\\ncan actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals, and\\nin flowers, that organs, which when mature become extremely different,\\nare at an early stage of growth exactly alike.', 'How inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation!', 'Why\\nshould the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such\\nextraordinarily shaped pieces of bone?', 'As Owen has remarked, the\\nbenefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of\\nparturition of mammals, will by no means explain the same construction\\nin the skulls of birds.', 'Why should similar bones have been created in\\nthe formation of the wing and leg of a bat, used as they are for such\\ntotally different purposes?', 'Why should one crustacean, which has an\\nextremely complex mouth formed of many parts, consequently always have\\nfewer legs; or conversely, those with many legs have simpler mouths?', 'Why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils in any individual\\nflower, though fitted for such widely different purposes, be all\\nconstructed on the same pattern?', 'On the theory of natural selection, we can satisfactorily answer these\\nquestions.', 'In the vertebrata, we see a series of internal vertebrae\\nbearing certain processes and appendages; in the articulata, we see the\\nbody divided into a series of segments, bearing external appendages;\\nand in flowering plants, we see a series of successive spiral whorls of\\nleaves.', 'An indefinite repetition of the same part or organ is the common\\ncharacteristic (as Owen has observed) of all low or little-modified\\nforms; therefore we may readily believe that the unknown progenitor of\\nthe vertebrata possessed many vertebrae; the unknown progenitor of\\nthe articulata, many segments; and the unknown progenitor of flowering\\nplants, many spiral whorls of leaves.', 'We have formerly seen that\\nparts many times repeated are eminently liable to vary in number and\\nstructure; consequently it is quite probable that natural selection,\\nduring a long-continued course of modification, should have seized on\\na certain number of the primordially similar elements, many times\\nrepeated, and have adapted them to the most diverse purposes.', 'And as\\nthe whole amount of modification will have been effected by slight\\nsuccessive steps, we need not wonder at discovering in such parts or\\norgans, a certain degree of fundamental resemblance, retained by the\\nstrong principle of inheritance.', 'In the great class of molluscs, though we can homologise the parts of\\none species with those of another and distinct species, we can indicate\\nbut few serial homologies; that is, we are seldom enabled to say that\\none part or organ is homologous with another in the same individual.', 'And\\nwe can understand this fact; for in molluscs, even in the lowest members\\nof the class, we do not find nearly so much indefinite repetition of\\nany one part, as we find in the other great classes of the animal and\\nvegetable kingdoms.', 'Naturalists frequently speak of the skull as formed of metamorphosed\\nvertebrae: the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs; the stamens and\\npistils of flowers as metamorphosed leaves; but it would in these cases\\nprobably be more correct, as Professor Huxley has remarked, to speak\\nof both skull and vertebrae, both jaws and legs, etc.,--as having been\\nmetamorphosed, not one from the other, but from some common element.', 'Naturalists, however, use such language only in a metaphorical sense:\\nthey are far from meaning that during a long course of descent,\\nprimordial organs of any kind--vertebrae in the one case and legs in the\\nother--have actually been modified into skulls or jaws.', 'Yet so strong\\nis the appearance of a modification of this nature having occurred,\\nthat naturalists can hardly avoid employing language having this plain\\nsignification.', 'On my view these terms may be used literally; and the\\nwonderful fact of the jaws, for instance, of a crab retaining numerous\\ncharacters, which they would probably have retained through inheritance,\\nif they had really been metamorphosed during a long course of descent\\nfrom true legs, or from some simple appendage, is explained.', 'EMBRYOLOGY.', 'It has already been casually remarked that certain organs in the\\nindividual, which when mature become widely different and serve for\\ndifferent purposes, are in the embryo exactly alike.', 'The embryos, also,\\nof distinct animals within the same class are often strikingly similar:\\na better proof of this cannot be given, than a circumstance mentioned\\nby Agassiz, namely, that having forgotten to ticket the embryo of some\\nvertebrate animal, he cannot now tell whether it be that of a mammal,\\nbird, or reptile.', 'The vermiform larvae of moths, flies, beetles, etc.,\\nresemble each other much more closely than do the mature insects; but\\nin the case of larvae, the embryos are active, and have been adapted\\nfor special lines of life.', 'A trace of the law of embryonic resemblance,\\nsometimes lasts till a rather late age: thus birds of the same genus,\\nand of closely allied genera, often resemble each other in their first\\nand second plumage; as we see in the spotted feathers in the thrush\\ngroup.', 'In the cat tribe, most of the species are striped or spotted\\nin lines; and stripes can be plainly distinguished in the whelp of\\nthe lion.', 'We occasionally though rarely see something of this kind in\\nplants: thus the embryonic leaves of the ulex or furze, and the first\\nleaves of the phyllodineous acaceas, are pinnate or divided like the\\nordinary leaves of the leguminosae.', 'The points of structure, in which the embryos of widely different\\nanimals of the same class resemble each other, often have no direct\\nrelation to their conditions of existence.', 'We cannot, for instance,\\nsuppose that in the embryos of the vertebrata the peculiar loop-like\\ncourse of the arteries near the branchial slits are related to similar\\nconditions,--in the young mammal which is nourished in the womb of its\\nmother, in the egg of the bird which is hatched in a nest, and in the\\nspawn of a frog under water.', 'We have no more reason to believe in such\\na relation, than we have to believe that the same bones in the hand of\\na man, wing of a bat, and fin of a porpoise, are related to similar\\nconditions of life.', 'No one will suppose that the stripes on the whelp\\nof a lion, or the spots on the young blackbird, are of any use to these\\nanimals, or are related to the conditions to which they are exposed.', 'The case, however, is different when an animal during any part of its\\nembryonic career is active, and has to provide for itself.', 'The period of\\nactivity may come on earlier or later in life; but whenever it comes on,\\nthe adaptation of the larva to its conditions of life is just as perfect\\nand as beautiful as in the adult animal.', 'From such special adaptations,\\nthe similarity of the larvae or active embryos of allied animals is\\nsometimes much obscured; and cases could be given of the larvae of two\\nspecies, or of two groups of species, differing quite as much, or\\neven more, from each other than do their adult parents.', 'In most cases,\\nhowever, the larvae, though active, still obey more or less closely the\\nlaw of common embryonic resemblance.', 'Cirripedes afford a good instance\\nof this: even the illustrious Cuvier did not perceive that a barnacle\\nwas, as it certainly is, a crustacean; but a glance at the larva shows\\nthis to be the case in an unmistakeable manner.', 'So again the two main\\ndivisions of cirripedes, the pedunculated and sessile, which differ\\nwidely in external appearance, have larvae in all their several stages\\nbarely distinguishable.', 'The embryo in the course of development generally rises in organisation:\\nI use this expression, though I am aware that it is hardly possible to\\ndefine clearly what is meant by the organisation being higher or lower.', 'But no one probably will dispute that the butterfly is higher than the\\ncaterpillar.', 'In some cases, however, the mature animal is generally\\nconsidered as lower in the scale than the larva, as with certain\\nparasitic crustaceans.', 'To refer once again to cirripedes: the larvae in\\nthe first stage have three pairs of legs, a very simple single eye, and\\na probosciformed mouth, with which they feed largely, for they increase\\nmuch in size.', 'In the second stage, answering to the chrysalis stage of\\nbutterflies, they have six pairs of beautifully constructed natatory\\nlegs, a pair of magnificent compound eyes, and extremely complex\\nantennae; but they have a closed and imperfect mouth, and cannot feed:\\ntheir function at this stage is, to search by their well-developed\\norgans of sense, and to reach by their active powers of swimming, a\\nproper place on which to become attached and to undergo their final\\nmetamorphosis.', 'When this is completed they are fixed for life: their\\nlegs are now converted into prehensile organs; they again obtain a\\nwell-constructed mouth; but they have no antennae, and their two eyes\\nare now reconverted into a minute, single, and very simple eye-spot.', 'In this last and complete state, cirripedes may be considered as\\neither more highly or more lowly organised than they were in the larval\\ncondition.', 'But in some genera the larvae become developed either into\\nhermaphrodites having the ordinary structure, or into what I have called\\ncomplemental males: and in the latter, the development has assuredly\\nbeen retrograde; for the male is a mere sack, which lives for a short\\ntime, and is destitute of mouth, stomach, or other organ of importance,\\nexcepting for reproduction.', 'We are so much accustomed to see differences in structure between the\\nembryo and the adult, and likewise a close similarity in the embryos of\\nwidely different animals within the same class, that we might be led to\\nlook at these facts as necessarily contingent in some manner on growth.', 'But there is no obvious reason why, for instance, the wing of a bat, or\\nthe fin of a porpoise, should not have been sketched out with all the\\nparts in proper proportion, as soon as any structure became visible in\\nthe embryo.', 'And in some whole groups of animals and in certain members\\nof other groups, the embryo does not at any period differ widely from\\nthe adult: thus Owen has remarked in regard to cuttle-fish, \"there is no\\nmetamorphosis; the cephalopodic character is manifested long before\\nthe parts of the embryo are completed;\" and again in spiders, \"there\\nis nothing worthy to be called a metamorphosis.\"', 'The larvae of insects,\\nwhether adapted to the most diverse and active habits, or quite\\ninactive, being fed by their parents or placed in the midst of proper\\nnutriment, yet nearly all pass through a similar worm-like stage of\\ndevelopment; but in some few cases, as in that of Aphis, if we look to\\nthe admirable drawings by Professor Huxley of the development of this\\ninsect, we see no trace of the vermiform stage.', 'How, then, can we explain these several facts in embryology,--namely\\nthe very general, but not universal difference in structure between the\\nembryo and the adult;--of parts in the same individual embryo, which\\nultimately become very unlike and serve for diverse purposes, being\\nat this early period of growth alike;--of embryos of different species\\nwithin the same class, generally, but not universally, resembling each\\nother;--of the structure of the embryo not being closely related to its\\nconditions of existence, except when the embryo becomes at any period\\nof life active and has to provide for itself;--of the embryo apparently\\nhaving sometimes a higher organisation than the mature animal, into\\nwhich it is developed.', 'I believe that all these facts can be explained,\\nas follows, on the view of descent with modification.', 'It is commonly assumed, perhaps from monstrosities often affecting the\\nembryo at a very early period, that slight variations necessarily\\nappear at an equally early period.', 'But we have little evidence on\\nthis head--indeed the evidence rather points the other way; for it is\\nnotorious that breeders of cattle, horses, and various fancy animals,\\ncannot positively tell, until some time after the animal has been born,\\nwhat its merits or form will ultimately turn out.', 'We see this plainly in\\nour own children; we cannot always tell whether the child will be tall\\nor short, or what its precise features will be.', 'The question is not, at\\nwhat period of life any variation has been caused, but at what period\\nit is fully displayed.', 'The cause may have acted, and I believe generally\\nhas acted, even before the embryo is formed; and the variation may be\\ndue to the male and female sexual elements having been affected by\\nthe conditions to which either parent, or their ancestors, have been\\nexposed.', 'Nevertheless an effect thus caused at a very early period, even\\nbefore the formation of the embryo, may appear late in life; as when\\nan hereditary disease, which appears in old age alone, has been\\ncommunicated to the offspring from the reproductive element of one\\nparent.', 'Or again, as when the horns of cross-bred cattle have been\\naffected by the shape of the horns of either parent.', \"For the welfare of\\na very young animal, as long as it remains in its mother's womb, or in\\nthe egg, or as long as it is nourished and protected by its parent,\\nit must be quite unimportant whether most of its characters are fully\\nacquired a little earlier or later in life.\", 'It would not signify, for\\ninstance, to a bird which obtained its food best by having a long beak,\\nwhether or not it assumed a beak of this particular length, as long as\\nit was fed by its parents.', 'Hence, I conclude, that it is quite possible,\\nthat each of the many successive modifications, by which each species\\nhas acquired its present structure, may have supervened at a not very\\nearly period of life; and some direct evidence from our domestic animals\\nsupports this view.', 'But in other cases it is quite possible that each\\nsuccessive modification, or most of them, may have appeared at an\\nextremely early period.', 'I have stated in the first chapter, that there is some evidence to\\nrender it probable, that at whatever age any variation first appears\\nin the parent, it tends to reappear at a corresponding age in the\\noffspring.', 'Certain variations can only appear at corresponding ages, for\\ninstance, peculiarities in the caterpillar, cocoon, or imago states of\\nthe silk-moth; or, again, in the horns of almost full-grown cattle.', 'But\\nfurther than this, variations which, for all that we can see, might have\\nappeared earlier or later in life, tend to appear at a corresponding\\nage in the offspring and parent.', 'I am far from meaning that this is\\ninvariably the case; and I could give a good many cases of variations\\n(taking the word in the largest sense) which have supervened at an\\nearlier age in the child than in the parent.', 'These two principles, if their truth be admitted, will, I believe,\\nexplain all the above specified leading facts in embryology.', 'But first\\nlet us look at a few analogous cases in domestic varieties.', 'Some authors\\nwho have written on Dogs, maintain that the greyhound and bulldog,\\nthough appearing so different, are really varieties most closely allied,\\nand have probably descended from the same wild stock; hence I was\\ncurious to see how far their puppies differed from each other: I was\\ntold by breeders that they differed just as much as their parents, and\\nthis, judging by the eye, seemed almost to be the case; but on actually\\nmeasuring the old dogs and their six-days old puppies, I found that\\nthe puppies had not nearly acquired their full amount of proportional\\ndifference.', 'So, again, I was told that the foals of cart and race-horses\\ndiffered as much as the full-grown animals; and this surprised me\\ngreatly, as I think it probable that the difference between these two\\nbreeds has been wholly caused by selection under domestication; but\\nhaving had careful measurements made of the dam and of a three-days old\\ncolt of a race and heavy cart-horse, I find that the colts have by no\\nmeans acquired their full amount of proportional difference.', 'As the evidence appears to me conclusive, that the several domestic\\nbreeds of Pigeon have descended from one wild species, I compared young\\npigeons of various breeds, within twelve hours after being hatched; I\\ncarefully measured the proportions (but will not here give details) of\\nthe beak, width of mouth, length of nostril and of eyelid, size of\\nfeet and length of leg, in the wild stock, in pouters, fantails, runts,\\nbarbs, dragons, carriers, and tumblers.', 'Now some of these birds, when\\nmature, differ so extraordinarily in length and form of beak, that\\nthey would, I cannot doubt, be ranked in distinct genera, had they been\\nnatural productions.', 'But when the nestling birds of these several breeds\\nwere placed in a row, though most of them could be distinguished from\\neach other, yet their proportional differences in the above specified\\nseveral points were incomparably less than in the full-grown birds.', 'Some\\ncharacteristic points of difference--for instance, that of the width\\nof mouth--could hardly be detected in the young.', 'But there was one\\nremarkable exception to this rule, for the young of the short-faced\\ntumbler differed from the young of the wild rock-pigeon and of the other\\nbreeds, in all its proportions, almost exactly as much as in the adult\\nstate.', 'The two principles above given seem to me to explain these facts in\\nregard to the later embryonic stages of our domestic varieties.', 'Fanciers\\nselect their horses, dogs, and pigeons, for breeding, when they are\\nnearly grown up: they are indifferent whether the desired qualities\\nand structures have been acquired earlier or later in life, if the\\nfull-grown animal possesses them.', \"And the cases just given, more\\nespecially that of pigeons, seem to show that the characteristic\\ndifferences which give value to each breed, and which have been\\naccumulated by man's selection, have not generally first appeared at\\nan early period of life, and have been inherited by the offspring at a\\ncorresponding not early period.\", 'But the case of the short-faced tumbler,\\nwhich when twelve hours old had acquired its proper proportions,\\nproves that this is not the universal rule; for here the characteristic\\ndifferences must either have appeared at an earlier period than usual,\\nor, if not so, the differences must have been inherited, not at the\\ncorresponding, but at an earlier age.', 'Now let us apply these facts and the above two principles--which latter,\\nthough not proved true, can be shown to be in some degree probable--to\\nspecies in a state of nature.', 'Let us take a genus of birds, descended\\non my theory from some one parent-species, and of which the several new\\nspecies have become modified through natural selection in accordance\\nwith their diverse habits.', 'Then, from the many slight successive steps\\nof variation having supervened at a rather late age, and having been\\ninherited at a corresponding age, the young of the new species of our\\nsupposed genus will manifestly tend to resemble each other much more\\nclosely than do the adults, just as we have seen in the case of\\npigeons.', 'We may extend this view to whole families or even classes.', 'The\\nfore-limbs, for instance, which served as legs in the parent-species,\\nmay become, by a long course of modification, adapted in one descendant\\nto act as hands, in another as paddles, in another as wings; and on the\\nabove two principles--namely of each successive modification supervening\\nat a rather late age, and being inherited at a corresponding late\\nage--the fore-limbs in the embryos of the several descendants of the\\nparent-species will still resemble each other closely, for they will not\\nhave been modified.', 'But in each individual new species, the embryonic\\nfore-limbs will differ greatly from the fore-limbs in the mature animal;\\nthe limbs in the latter having undergone much modification at a rather\\nlate period of life, and having thus been converted into hands, or\\npaddles, or wings.', 'Whatever influence long-continued exercise or use on\\nthe one hand, and disuse on the other, may have in modifying an organ,\\nsuch influence will mainly affect the mature animal, which has come\\nto its full powers of activity and has to gain its own living; and the\\neffects thus produced will be inherited at a corresponding mature age.', 'Whereas the young will remain unmodified, or be modified in a lesser\\ndegree, by the effects of use and disuse.', 'In certain cases the successive steps of variation might supervene, from\\ncauses of which we are wholly ignorant, at a very early period of life,\\nor each step might be inherited at an earlier period than that at which\\nit first appeared.', 'In either case (as with the short-faced tumbler) the\\nyoung or embryo would closely resemble the mature parent-form.', 'We have\\nseen that this is the rule of development in certain whole groups of\\nanimals, as with cuttle-fish and spiders, and with a few members of the\\ngreat class of insects, as with Aphis.', 'With respect to the final cause\\nof the young in these cases not undergoing any metamorphosis, or closely\\nresembling their parents from their earliest age, we can see that this\\nwould result from the two following contingencies; firstly, from the\\nyoung, during a course of modification carried on for many generations,\\nhaving to provide for their own wants at a very early stage of\\ndevelopment, and secondly, from their following exactly the same habits\\nof life with their parents; for in this case, it would be indispensable\\nfor the existence of the species, that the child should be modified at\\na very early age in the same manner with its parents, in accordance with\\ntheir similar habits.', 'Some further explanation, however, of the embryo\\nnot undergoing any metamorphosis is perhaps requisite.', 'If, on the other\\nhand, it profited the young to follow habits of life in any degree\\ndifferent from those of their parent, and consequently to be constructed\\nin a slightly different manner, then, on the principle of inheritance at\\ncorresponding ages, the active young or larvae might easily be rendered\\nby natural selection different to any conceivable extent from their\\nparents.', 'Such differences might, also, become correlated with successive\\nstages of development; so that the larvae, in the first stage, might\\ndiffer greatly from the larvae in the second stage, as we have seen to\\nbe the case with cirripedes.', 'The adult might become fitted for sites or\\nhabits, in which organs of locomotion or of the senses, etc., would be\\nuseless; and in this case the final metamorphosis would be said to be\\nretrograde.', 'As all the organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived on\\nthis earth have to be classed together, and as all have been connected\\nby the finest gradations, the best, or indeed, if our collections were\\nnearly perfect, the only possible arrangement, would be genealogical.', 'Descent being on my view the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists\\nhave been seeking under the term of the natural system.', 'On this view\\nwe can understand how it is that, in the eyes of most naturalists, the\\nstructure of the embryo is even more important for classification than\\nthat of the adult.', 'For the embryo is the animal in its less modified\\nstate; and in so far it reveals the structure of its progenitor.', 'In\\ntwo groups of animal, however much they may at present differ from each\\nother in structure and habits, if they pass through the same or similar\\nembryonic stages, we may feel assured that they have both descended from\\nthe same or nearly similar parents, and are therefore in that degree\\nclosely related.', 'Thus, community in embryonic structure reveals\\ncommunity of descent.', 'It will reveal this community of descent, however\\nmuch the structure of the adult may have been modified and obscured; we\\nhave seen, for instance, that cirripedes can at once be recognised by\\ntheir larvae as belonging to the great class of crustaceans.', 'As the\\nembryonic state of each species and group of species partially shows us\\nthe structure of their less modified ancient progenitors, we can clearly\\nsee why ancient and extinct forms of life should resemble the embryos of\\ntheir descendants,--our existing species.', 'Agassiz believes this to be a\\nlaw of nature; but I am bound to confess that I only hope to see the\\nlaw hereafter proved true.', 'It can be proved true in those cases alone in\\nwhich the ancient state, now supposed to be represented in many embryos,\\nhas not been obliterated, either by the successive variations in a long\\ncourse of modification having supervened at a very early age, or by the\\nvariations having been inherited at an earlier period than that at which\\nthey first appeared.', 'It should also be borne in mind, that the supposed\\nlaw of resemblance of ancient forms of life to the embryonic stages of\\nrecent forms, may be true, but yet, owing to the geological record not\\nextending far enough back in time, may remain for a long period, or for\\never, incapable of demonstration.', 'Thus, as it seems to me, the leading facts in embryology, which are\\nsecond in importance to none in natural history, are explained on the\\nprinciple of slight modifications not appearing, in the many descendants\\nfrom some one ancient progenitor, at a very early period in the life of\\neach, though perhaps caused at the earliest, and being inherited at a\\ncorresponding not early period.', 'Embryology rises greatly in interest,\\nwhen we thus look at the embryo as a picture, more or less obscured, of\\nthe common parent-form of each great class of animals.', 'RUDIMENTARY, ATROPHIED, OR ABORTED ORGANS.', 'Organs or parts in this strange condition, bearing the stamp of\\ninutility, are extremely common throughout nature.', 'For instance,\\nrudimentary mammae are very general in the males of mammals: I presume\\nthat the \"bastard-wing\" in birds may be safely considered as a digit\\nin a rudimentary state: in very many snakes one lobe of the lungs is\\nrudimentary; in other snakes there are rudiments of the pelvis and hind\\nlimbs.', 'Some of the cases of rudimentary organs are extremely curious;\\nfor instance, the presence of teeth in foetal whales, which when grown\\nup have not a tooth in their heads; and the presence of teeth, which\\nnever cut through the gums, in the upper jaws of our unborn calves.', 'It\\nhas even been stated on good authority that rudiments of teeth can be\\ndetected in the beaks of certain embryonic birds.', 'Nothing can be plainer\\nthan that wings are formed for flight, yet in how many insects do we see\\nwings so reduced in size as to be utterly incapable of flight, and not\\nrarely lying under wing-cases, firmly soldered together!', 'The meaning of rudimentary organs is often quite unmistakeable: for\\ninstance there are beetles of the same genus (and even of the same\\nspecies) resembling each other most closely in all respects, one\\nof which will have full-sized wings, and another mere rudiments of\\nmembrane; and here it is impossible to doubt, that the rudiments\\nrepresent wings.', 'Rudimentary organs sometimes retain their potentiality,\\nand are merely not developed: this seems to be the case with the mammae\\nof male mammals, for many instances are on record of these organs having\\nbecome well developed in full-grown males, and having secreted milk.', 'So\\nagain there are normally four developed and two rudimentary teats in\\nthe udders of the genus Bos, but in our domestic cows the two sometimes\\nbecome developed and give milk.', 'In individual plants of the same\\nspecies the petals sometimes occur as mere rudiments, and sometimes in\\na well-developed state.', 'In plants with separated sexes, the male flowers\\noften have a rudiment of a pistil; and Kolreuter found that by crossing\\nsuch male plants with an hermaphrodite species, the rudiment of the\\npistil in the hybrid offspring was much increased in size; and this\\nshows that the rudiment and the perfect pistil are essentially alike in\\nnature.', 'An organ serving for two purposes, may become rudimentary or utterly\\naborted for one, even the more important purpose; and remain perfectly\\nefficient for the other.', 'Thus in plants, the office of the pistil is to\\nallow the pollen-tubes to reach the ovules protected in the ovarium at\\nits base.', 'The pistil consists of a stigma supported on the style; but in\\nsome Compositae, the male florets, which of course cannot be fecundated,\\nhave a pistil, which is in a rudimentary state, for it is not crowned\\nwith a stigma; but the style remains well developed, and is clothed with\\nhairs as in other compositae, for the purpose of brushing the pollen out\\nof the surrounding anthers.', 'Again, an organ may become rudimentary for\\nits proper purpose, and be used for a distinct object: in certain fish\\nthe swim-bladder seems to be rudimentary for its proper function of\\ngiving buoyancy, but has become converted into a nascent breathing organ\\nor lung.', 'Other similar instances could be given.', 'Rudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are very\\nliable to vary in degree of development and in other respects.', 'Moreover,\\nin closely allied species, the degree to which the same organ has been\\nrendered rudimentary occasionally differs much.', 'This latter fact is well\\nexemplified in the state of the wings of the female moths in certain\\ngroups.', 'Rudimentary organs may be utterly aborted;

but\\nthis may sometimes be seen.', 'In tracing the homologies of the same\\npart in different members of a class, nothing is more common, or more\\nnecessary, than the use and discovery of rudiments.', 'This is well shown\\nin the drawings given by Owen of the bones of the leg of the horse, ox,\\nand rhinoceros.', 'It is an important fact that rudimentary organs, such as teeth in the\\nupper jaws of whales and ruminants, can often be detected in the embryo,\\nbut afterwards wholly disappear.', 'It is also, I believe, a universal\\nrule, that a rudimentary part or organ is of greater size relatively to\\nthe adjoining parts in the embryo, than in the adult; so that the organ\\nat this early age is less rudimentary, or even cannot be said to be in\\nany degree rudimentary.', 'Hence, also, a rudimentary organ in the adult,\\nis often said to have retained its embryonic condition.', 'I have now given the leading facts with respect to rudimentary organs.', 'In reflecting on them, every one must be struck with astonishment: for\\nthe same reasoning power which tells us plainly that most parts and\\norgans are exquisitely adapted for certain purposes, tells us with equal\\nplainness that these rudimentary or atrophied organs, are imperfect and\\nuseless.', 'In works on natural history rudimentary organs are generally\\nsaid to have been created \"for the sake of symmetry,\" or in order \"to\\ncomplete the scheme of nature;\" but this seems to me no explanation,\\nmerely a restatement of the fact.', 'Would it be thought sufficient to\\nsay that because planets revolve in elliptic courses round the sun,\\nsatellites follow the same course round the planets, for the sake of\\nsymmetry, and to complete the scheme of nature?', 'An eminent physiologist\\naccounts for the presence of rudimentary organs, by supposing that they\\nserve to excrete matter in excess, or injurious to the system; but can\\nwe suppose that the minute papilla, which often represents the pistil\\nin male flowers, and which is formed merely of cellular tissue, can thus\\nact?', 'Can we suppose that the formation of rudimentary teeth which are\\nsubsequently absorbed, can be of any service to the rapidly growing\\nembryonic calf by the excretion of precious phosphate of lime?', \"When a\\nman's fingers have been amputated, imperfect nails sometimes appear on\\nthe stumps: I could as soon believe that these vestiges of nails have\\nappeared, not from unknown laws of growth, but in order to excrete horny\\nmatter, as that the rudimentary nails on the fin of the manatee were\\nformed for this purpose.\", 'On my view of descent with modification, the origin of rudimentary\\norgans is simple.', 'We have plenty of cases of rudimentary organs in our\\ndomestic productions,--as the stump of a tail in tailless breeds,--the\\nvestige of an ear in earless breeds,--the reappearance of minute\\ndangling horns in hornless breeds of cattle, more especially, according\\nto Youatt, in young animals,--and the state of the whole flower in the\\ncauliflower.', 'We often see rudiments of various parts in monsters.', 'But\\nI doubt whether any of these cases throw light on the origin of\\nrudimentary organs in a state of nature, further than by showing that\\nrudiments can be produced; for I doubt whether species under nature ever\\nundergo abrupt changes.', 'I believe that disuse has been the main agency;\\nthat it has led in successive generations to the gradual reduction of\\nvarious organs, until they have become rudimentary,--as in the case of\\nthe eyes of animals inhabiting dark caverns, and of the wings of birds\\ninhabiting oceanic islands, which have seldom been forced to take\\nflight, and have ultimately lost the power of flying.', 'Again, an organ\\nuseful under certain conditions, might become injurious under others,\\nas with the wings of beetles living on small and exposed islands; and in\\nthis case natural selection would continue slowly to reduce the organ,\\nuntil it was rendered harmless and rudimentary.', 'Any change in function, which can be effected by insensibly small steps,\\nis within the power of natural selection; so that an organ rendered,\\nduring changed habits of life, useless or injurious for one purpose,\\nmight easily be modified and used for another purpose.', 'Or an organ\\nmight be retained for one alone of its former functions.', 'An organ, when\\nrendered useless, may well be variable, for its variations cannot be\\nchecked by natural selection.', 'At whatever period of life disuse or\\nselection reduces an organ, and this will generally be when the being\\nhas come to maturity and to its full powers of action, the principle\\nof inheritance at corresponding ages will reproduce the organ in its\\nreduced state at the same age, and consequently will seldom affect or\\nreduce it in the embryo.', 'Thus we can understand the greater relative\\nsize of rudimentary organs in the embryo, and their lesser relative size\\nin the adult.', 'But if each step of the process of reduction were to\\nbe inherited, not at the corresponding age, but at an extremely early\\nperiod of life (as we have good reason to believe to be possible) the\\nrudimentary part would tend to be wholly lost, and we should have a case\\nof complete abortion.', 'The principle, also, of economy, explained in a\\nformer chapter, by which the materials forming any part or structure, if\\nnot useful to the possessor, will be saved as far as is possible, will\\nprobably often come into play; and this will tend to cause the entire\\nobliteration of a rudimentary organ.', 'As the presence of rudimentary organs is thus due to the tendency\\nin every part of the organisation, which has long existed, to\\nbe inherited--we can understand, on the genealogical view of\\nclassification, how it is that systematists have found rudimentary\\nparts as useful as, or even sometimes more useful than, parts of high\\nphysiological importance.', 'Rudimentary organs may be compared with the\\nletters in a word, still retained in the spelling, but become useless\\nin the pronunciation, but which serve as a clue in seeking for its\\nderivation.', 'On the view of descent with modification, we may conclude\\nthat the existence of organs in a rudimentary, imperfect, and useless\\ncondition, or quite aborted, far from presenting a strange difficulty,\\nas they assuredly do on the ordinary doctrine of creation, might\\neven have been anticipated, and can be accounted for by the laws of\\ninheritance.', 'SUMMARY.', 'In this chapter I have attempted to show, that the subordination of\\ngroup to group in all organisms throughout all time; that the nature of\\nthe relationship, by which all living and extinct beings are united by\\ncomplex, radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities into one\\ngrand system; the rules followed and the difficulties encountered by\\nnaturalists in their classifications; the value set upon characters, if\\nconstant and prevalent, whether of high vital importance, or of the most\\ntrifling importance, or, as in rudimentary organs, of no importance; the\\nwide opposition in value between analogical or adaptive characters, and\\ncharacters of true affinity; and other such rules;--all naturally follow\\non the view of the common parentage of those forms which are considered\\nby naturalists as allied, together with their modification through\\nnatural selection, with its contingencies of extinction and divergence\\nof character.', 'In considering this view of classification, it should be\\nborne in mind that the element of descent has been universally used in\\nranking together the sexes, ages, and acknowledged varieties of the same\\nspecies, however different they may be in structure.', 'If we extend the\\nuse of this element of descent,--the only certainly known cause of\\nsimilarity in organic beings,--we shall understand what is meant by the\\nnatural system: it is genealogical in its attempted arrangement,\\nwith the grades of acquired difference marked by the terms varieties,\\nspecies, genera, families, orders, and classes.', 'On this same view of descent with modification, all the great facts in\\nMorphology become intelligible,--whether we look to the same pattern\\ndisplayed in the homologous organs, to whatever purpose applied, of the\\ndifferent species of a class; or to the homologous parts constructed on\\nthe same pattern in each individual animal and plant.', 'On the principle of successive slight variations, not necessarily\\nor generally supervening at a very early period of life, and being\\ninherited at a corresponding period, we can understand the great leading\\nfacts in Embryology; namely, the resemblance in an individual embryo of\\nthe homologous parts, which when matured will become widely different\\nfrom each other in structure and function; and the resemblance in\\ndifferent species of a class of the homologous parts or organs, though\\nfitted in the adult members for purposes as different as possible.', 'Larvae are active embryos, which have become specially modified in\\nrelation to their habits of life, through the principle of modifications\\nbeing inherited at corresponding ages.', 'On this same principle--and\\nbearing in mind, that when organs are reduced in size, either from\\ndisuse or selection, it will generally be at that period of life when\\nthe being has to provide for its own wants, and bearing in mind how\\nstrong is the principle of inheritance--the occurrence of rudimentary\\norgans and their final abortion, present to us no inexplicable\\ndifficulties; on the contrary, their presence might have been even\\nanticipated.', 'The importance of embryological characters and of\\nrudimentary organs in classification is intelligible, on the view that\\nan arrangement is only so far natural as it is genealogical.', 'Finally, the several classes of facts which have been considered in\\nthis chapter, seem to me to proclaim so plainly, that the innumerable\\nspecies, genera, and families of organic beings, with which this world\\nis peopled, have all descended, each within its own class or group, from\\ncommon parents, and have all been modified in the course of descent,\\nthat I should without hesitation adopt this view, even if it were\\nunsupported by other facts or arguments.', '14.', 'RECAPITULATION AND CONCLUSION.', 'Recapitulation of the difficulties on the theory of Natural Selection.', 'Recapitulation of the general and special circumstances in its favour.', 'Causes of the general belief in the immutability of species.', 'How far the\\ntheory of natural selection may be extended.', 'Effects of its adoption on\\nthe study of Natural history.', 'Concluding remarks.', 'As this whole volume is one long argument, it may be convenient to the\\nreader to have the leading facts and inferences briefly recapitulated.', 'That many and grave objections may be advanced against the theory of\\ndescent with modification through natural selection, I do not deny.', 'I\\nhave endeavoured to give to them their full force.', 'Nothing at first can\\nappear more difficult to believe than that the more complex organs and\\ninstincts should have been perfected, not by means superior to, though\\nanalogous with, human reason, but by the accumulation of innumerable\\nslight variations, each good for the individual possessor.', 'Nevertheless,\\nthis difficulty, though appearing to our imagination insuperably great,\\ncannot be considered real if we admit the following propositions,\\nnamely,--that gradations in the perfection of any organ or instinct,\\nwhich we may consider, either do now exist or could have existed, each\\ngood of its kind,--that all organs and instincts are, in ever so slight\\na degree, variable,--and, lastly, that there is a struggle for existence\\nleading to the preservation of each profitable deviation of structure or\\ninstinct.', 'The truth of these propositions cannot, I think, be disputed.', 'It is, no doubt, extremely difficult even to conjecture by what\\ngradations many structures have been perfected, more especially amongst\\nbroken and failing groups of organic beings;

and one of the\\nmost curious of these is the existence of two or three defined castes\\nof workers or sterile females in the same community of ants; but I have\\nattempted to show how this difficulty can be mastered.', 'With respect to the almost universal sterility of species when first\\ncrossed, which forms so remarkable a contrast with the almost universal\\nfertility of varieties when crossed, I must refer the reader to the\\nrecapitulation of the facts given at the end of the eighth chapter,\\nwhich seem to me conclusively to show that this sterility is no more\\na special endowment than is the incapacity of two trees to be grafted\\ntogether, but that it is incidental on constitutional differences in the\\nreproductive systems of the intercrossed species.', 'We see the truth of\\nthis conclusion in the vast difference in the result, when the same two\\nspecies are crossed reciprocally; that is, when one species is first\\nused as the father and then as the mother.', 'The fertility of varieties when intercrossed and of their mongrel\\noffspring cannot be considered as universal; nor is their very general\\nfertility surprising when we remember that it is not likely that either\\ntheir constitutions or their reproductive systems should have been\\nprofoundly modified.', 'Moreover, most of the varieties which have been\\nexperimentised on have been produced under domestication; and as\\ndomestication apparently tends to eliminate sterility, we ought not to\\nexpect it also to produce sterility.', 'The sterility of hybrids is a very different case from that of first\\ncrosses, for their reproductive organs are more or less functionally\\nimpotent; whereas in first crosses the organs on both sides are in a\\nperfect condition.', 'As we continually see that organisms of all kinds\\nare rendered in some degree sterile from their constitutions having been\\ndisturbed by slightly different and new conditions of life, we need\\nnot feel surprise at hybrids being in some degree sterile, for their\\nconstitutions can hardly fail to have been disturbed from being\\ncompounded of two distinct organisations.', 'This parallelism is supported\\nby another parallel, but directly opposite, class of facts; namely, that\\nthe vigour and fertility of all organic beings are increased by slight\\nchanges in their conditions of life, and that the offspring of slightly\\nmodified forms or varieties acquire from being crossed increased vigour\\nand fertility.', 'So that, on the one hand, considerable changes in the\\nconditions of life and crosses between greatly modified forms, lessen\\nfertility; and on the other hand, lesser changes in the conditions of\\nlife and crosses between less modified forms, increase fertility.', 'Turning to geographical distribution, the difficulties encountered\\non the theory of descent with modification are grave enough.', 'All the\\nindividuals of the same species, and all the species of the same genus,\\nor even higher group, must have descended from common parents;

and this in some instances necessarily implies\\nan enormous amount of modification in the descendants.', 'Throughout whole\\nclasses various structures are formed on the same pattern, and at an\\nembryonic age the species closely resemble each other.', 'Therefore I\\ncannot doubt that the theory of descent with modification embraces all\\nthe members of the same class.', 'I believe that animals have descended\\nfrom at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an equal or\\nlesser number.', 'Analogy would lead me one step further, namely, to the belief that all\\nanimals and plants have descended from some one prototype.', 'But analogy\\nmay be a deceitful guide.', 'Nevertheless all living things have much in\\ncommon, in their chemical composition, their germinal vesicles, their\\ncellular structure, and their laws of growth and reproduction.', 'We see\\nthis even in so trifling a circumstance as that the same poison often\\nsimilarly affects plants and animals; or that the poison secreted by\\nthe gall-fly produces monstrous growths on the wild rose or oak-tree.', 'Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic\\nbeings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some\\none primordial form, into which life was first breathed.', 'When the views\\nentertained in this volume on the origin of species, or when analogous\\nviews are generally admitted, we can dimly foresee that there will be a\\nconsiderable revolution in natural history.', 'Systematists will be able\\nto pursue their labours as at present; but they will not be incessantly\\nhaunted by the shadowy doubt whether this or that form be in essence\\na species.', 'This I feel sure, and I speak after experience, will be no\\nslight relief.', 'The endless disputes whether or not some fifty species\\nof British brambles are true species will cease.', 'Systematists will\\nhave only to decide (not that this will be easy) whether any form be\\nsufficiently constant and distinct from other forms, to be capable of\\ndefinition; and if definable, whether the differences be sufficiently\\nimportant to deserve a specific name.', 'This latter point will become a\\nfar more essential consideration than it is at present; for differences,\\nhowever slight, between any two forms, if not blended by intermediate\\ngradations, are looked at by most naturalists as sufficient to raise\\nboth forms to the rank of species.', 'Hereafter we shall be compelled to\\nacknowledge that the only distinction between species and well-marked\\nvarieties is, that the latter are known, or believed, to be connected\\nat the present day by intermediate gradations, whereas species\\nwere formerly thus connected.', 'Hence, without quite rejecting the\\nconsideration of the present existence of intermediate gradations\\nbetween any two forms, we shall be led to weigh more carefully and to\\nvalue higher the actual amount of difference between them.', 'It is quite\\npossible that forms now generally acknowledged to be merely varieties\\nmay hereafter be thought worthy of specific names, as with the primrose\\nand cowslip; and in this case scientific and common language will come\\ninto accordance.', 'In short, we shall have to treat species in the same\\nmanner as those naturalists treat genera, who admit that genera are\\nmerely artificial combinations made for convenience.', 'This may not be a\\ncheering prospect; but we shall at least be freed from the vain search\\nfor the undiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species.', 'The other and more general departments of natural history will rise\\ngreatly in interest.', 'The terms used by naturalists of affinity,\\nrelationship, community of type, paternity, morphology, adaptive\\ncharacters, rudimentary and aborted organs, etc., will cease to be\\nmetaphorical, and will have a plain signification.', 'When we no longer\\nlook at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as at something\\nwholly beyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of\\nnature as one which has had a history; when we contemplate every complex\\nstructure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances, each\\nuseful to the possessor, nearly in the same way as when we look at\\nany great mechanical invention as the summing up of the labour, the\\nexperience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when\\nwe thus view each organic being, how far more interesting, I speak from\\nexperience, will the study of natural history become!', 'A grand and almost untrodden field of inquiry will be opened, on the\\ncauses and laws of variation, on correlation of growth, on the effects\\nof use and disuse, on the direct action of external conditions, and so\\nforth.', 'The study of domestic productions will rise immensely in value.', 'A new variety raised by man will be a far more important and interesting\\nsubject for study than one more species added to the infinitude of\\nalready recorded species.', 'Our classifications will come to be, as far as\\nthey can be so made, genealogies; and will then truly give what may be\\ncalled the plan of creation.', 'The rules for classifying will no doubt\\nbecome simpler when we have a definite object in view.', 'We possess no\\npedigrees or armorial bearings; and we have to discover and trace\\nthe many diverging lines of descent in our natural genealogies, by\\ncharacters of any kind which have long been inherited.', 'Rudimentary\\norgans will speak infallibly with respect to the nature of long-lost\\nstructures.', 'Species and groups of species, which are called aberrant,\\nand which may fancifully be called living fossils, will aid us in\\nforming a picture of the ancient forms of life.', 'Embryology will reveal\\nto us the structure, in some degree obscured, of the prototypes of each\\ngreat class.', 'When we can feel assured that all the individuals of the same species,\\nand all the closely allied species of most genera, have within a not\\nvery remote period descended from one parent, and have migrated\\nfrom some one birthplace; and when we better know the many means\\nof migration, then, by the light which geology now throws, and will\\ncontinue to throw, on former changes of climate and of the level of the\\nland, we shall surely be enabled to trace in an admirable manner\\nthe former migrations of the inhabitants of the whole world.', 'Even at\\npresent, by comparing the differences of the inhabitants of the sea\\non the opposite sides of a continent, and the nature of the various\\ninhabitants of that continent in relation to their apparent means of\\nimmigration, some light can be thrown on ancient geography.', 'The noble science of Geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection\\nof the record.', 'The crust of the earth with its embedded remains must not\\nbe looked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection made\\nat hazard and at rare intervals.', 'The accumulation of each great\\nfossiliferous formation will be recognised as having depended on an\\nunusual concurrence of circumstances, and the blank intervals between\\nthe successive stages as having been of vast duration.', 'But we shall be\\nable to gauge with some security the duration of these intervals by a\\ncomparison of the preceding and succeeding organic forms.', 'We must be\\ncautious in attempting to correlate as strictly contemporaneous\\ntwo formations, which include few identical species, by the general\\nsuccession of their forms of life.', 'As species are produced and\\nexterminated by slowly acting and still existing causes, and not\\nby miraculous acts of creation and by catastrophes; and as the most\\nimportant of all causes of organic change is one which is almost\\nindependent of altered and perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions,\\nnamely, the mutual relation of organism to organism,--the improvement of\\none being entailing the improvement or the extermination of others; it\\nfollows, that the amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutive\\nformations probably serves as a fair measure of the lapse of actual\\ntime.', 'A number of species, however, keeping in a body might remain for a\\nlong period unchanged, whilst within this same period, several of these\\nspecies, by migrating into new countries and coming into competition\\nwith foreign associates, might become modified; so that we must not\\noverrate the accuracy of organic change as a measure of time.', \"During\\nearly periods of the earth's history, when the forms of life were\\nprobably fewer and simpler, the rate of change was probably slower; and\\nat the first dawn of life, when very few forms of the simplest structure\\nexisted, the rate of change may have been slow in an extreme degree.\", 'The\\nwhole history of the world, as at present known, although of a length\\nquite incomprehensible by us, will hereafter be recognised as a mere\\nfragment of time, compared with the ages which have elapsed since\\nthe first creature, the progenitor of innumerable extinct and living\\ndescendants, was created.', 'In the distant future I see open fields for far more important\\nresearches.', 'Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the\\nnecessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation.', 'Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.', 'Authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view\\nthat each species has been independently created.', 'To my mind it accords\\nbetter with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator,\\nthat the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants\\nof the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those\\ndetermining the birth and death of the individual.', 'When I view all\\nbeings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some\\nfew beings which lived long before the first bed of the Silurian system\\nwas deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled.', 'Judging from the\\npast, we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit its\\nunaltered likeness to a distant futurity.', 'And of the species now living\\nvery few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity;\\nfor the manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows that the\\ngreater number of species of each genus, and all the species of many\\ngenera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly extinct.', 'We\\ncan so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to foretel that it\\nwill be the common and widely-spread species, belonging to the larger\\nand dominant groups, which will ultimately prevail and procreate new\\nand dominant species.', 'As all the living forms of life are the lineal\\ndescendants of those which lived long before the Silurian epoch, we may\\nfeel certain that the ordinary succession by generation has never once\\nbeen broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the whole world.', 'Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally\\ninappreciable length.', 'And as natural selection works solely by and for\\nthe good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to\\nprogress towards perfection.', 'It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many\\nplants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various\\ninsects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth,\\nand to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different\\nfrom each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner,\\nhave all been produced by laws acting around us.', 'These laws, taken in\\nthe largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction; Inheritance which is\\nalmost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct\\naction of the external conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a\\nRatio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a\\nconsequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and\\nthe Extinction of less-improved forms.', 'Thus, from the war of nature,\\nfrom famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable\\nof conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly\\nfollows.', 'There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several\\npowers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one;\\nand that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed\\nlaw of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful\\nand most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.']\n",
